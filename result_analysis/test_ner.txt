The B-ORG

forecasts o
that o
the o
global o
economy o
will o
continue o
growing o
in o
1996 o
and o
that o
this o
favorable o
situation o
is o
extremely o
beneficial o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
development o
and o
will o
provide o
many o
development o
opportunities o
. o

According o
to o
the o
forecast o
, o
this o
year o
's o
global o
economic o
growth o
rate o
will o
reach o
4.1 o
percent o
. o

The o
main o
factor o
promoting o
economic o
growth o
is o
the o
still o
powerful o
economic o
development o
in o
the o
Asian o
region o
. o

The o
whole o

's o
economic o
growth o
rate o
will o

7.9 o
percent o
, o
with o
China B-GPE
's o
growth o
rate o
possibly o
being o
as o
high o
as o
9.7 o
percent o
. o

According o
to o
the o
analysis o
of o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Statistical I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
, o
the o
extremely o
favorable o
conditions o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
development o
mainly o
comprise o
of o
two o
aspects o
: o
the o
first o
being o
the o
sustained o
growth o
of o
the o
world o
economy o
and o
international o
trade o
, o
which o
indicates o
the o
steady o
expansion o
of o

demands o
, o
provides o
a o
comparatively o
favorable o
international o
environment o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
export o
trade o
development o
. o

The o
second o
is o
China B-GPE
's o
large o
margin o
reduction o
of o
tariffs o
in o
1996 o
which o
will o
further o
improve o
its o
investment o
environment o
and o
attract o
more o
foreign o
businessmen o
to o
come o
to o
invest o
. o

The o
analysis o
shows o
that o
, o
with o
the o
situation o
of o
greater o
opportunity o
and o
extremely o
favorable o
international o
situations o
, o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
development o
still o
faces o
severe o
challenges o
this o
year o
. o

With o
a o
background o
of o
rapid o
economic o
development o
, o
there o
still o
exist o
many o
difficulties o
, o
among o
these o
are o
outstanding o
problems o
such o
as o
inflation o
, o
a o
weak o
agricultural o
base o
, o
insufficient o
vitality o
in o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
, o
etc o
. o

While o
implementing o
global o
trade o
liberalization o
, o
China B-GPE
must o
implement o
reforms o
on o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
so o
as o
to o
improve o
its o
own o
competitiveness o
. o

Currently o
, o
some o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
are o
having o
management o
difficulties o
, o
moreover o
the o
debt o
of o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
reaches o
as o
high o
as o
700 o
billion o
yuan o
, o
and o
their o
product o
quality o
is o
uneven o
. o

If o
there o
is o
no o
improvement o
, o
it o
will o
be o
very o
difficult o
for o
them o
to o
participate o
in o
the o
competition o
in o
overseas o
markets o
. o

According o
to o
analysis o
, o
at o
present o
, o
the o
rising o
speed o
of o
developing o
countries o
' o
economies o
also o
makes o
China B-GPE
face o
fierce o
international o
competition o
in o
domains o

as o

that o
" o
Jiujiang B-GPE
is o
situated o
midway o

a o

unbounded o

" o

He o
also o
embossed o
the o
name o
for o
the o
Jiujiang o
Station o
. o

Jiujiang B-GPE
is o
the o
thoroughfare o
connecting o
Yangtze B-LOC
River I-LOC

north o

However o
, o
the o

having o
a o

on o
both o
the o
local o

the o
life o
of o
the o

for o

comes o
, o
the o
rising o
waters o
of o
the B-LOC

invade o

has o
made o
the o

an o
intense o

over o
the o

of o
Eastern o

, o
the o
first o
time o
in o

, o
is o
a o
good o

. o

After o
the o

ASEAN B-ORG
, o
with o

South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, o
strengthened o
their o
cooperation o
and o
jointly o
planned o
development o
, o
becoming o
a o
force o
that o
holds o
the o

. o

Therefore o
, o
the o
holding o
of o
the o
informal o
meeting o
of o
heads o
of o
the o
countries o
in o
eastern o
Asia B-LOC
possesses o
important o
significance o
in o
promoting o
cooperation o
between o
all o
countries o
, o
in o
safeguarding o
regional o
and o
global o
security o
, o
and o
in o
accelerating o
the o
development o
towards o
world o
multi-polarization o
. o

The o
development o
of o
countries o
can o
not o
be o
separated o
from o
the o
region o
, o
and o
that o
of o
the o
region o
can o
not o
be o
separated o
from o
the o
globe o
. o

Discarding o
old o
concepts o
and o
establishing o
new o
international o
political o
and o
economic o
orders o
conforms o
with o
the o
main o
trend o
of o
the o
times o
in o
which o
people o
of o
all o
countries o
demand o
peace o
, o
request o
development o
, o
seek o
stability o
and o
promote o

. o

To o
correctly o
understand o
the o
relationship o
between o
economic o

, o
political o
stability o
, o
social o
harmony o
and o
national o

, o
to o

and o
the o
whole o
world o
to o
travel o
on o
the o
road o
of o
peaceful o

, o
to o
jointly o
discuss o
east o
Asian o
economic o
cooperation o
in o
the o
21st o
century o
and o
forecasting o
the o
future o
development o
of o
eastern o
Asia B-LOC
are o
subjects o
being o
discussed o
at o
this o
informal o
meeting o
of o
heads o
of o
state o
in o
eastern o
Asia B-LOC
. o

Peace o
is o
a o
precondition o
to o
economic o
development o
. o

Without o
a o
peaceful o
environment o
, o
any o
construction o
undertaking o
would o
be o
impossible o
to o
discuss o
. o

Only o
when o
long o
- o
term o
peace o
is o
realized o
can o
the o
realization o
of o
sustained o
development o
be o
possible o
. o

Therefore o
it o
is o
necessary o
to o
breed o
a o
new o
kind o
of o
security o
concept o
and o
to o
seek o
new o
methods o
to o
safeguard o
peace o
. o

To o
establish o
relations o
between o
countries o
on o
the o
basis o
of o
the o
five o
principles o
, o
namely o
mutual o
respect o
of o
sovereignty o
and o
integrity o
of o
territory o
, o
non-aggression o
, o
non-interference o
in o
internal o
affairs o
, o
equality o
and o
mutual o
benefit o
, o
and o
peaceful o
coexistence o
, o
is o
the o
political o
basis o
and o
precondition o
for o
global o
and o
regional o
security o
. o

That o
all o
countries o
strengthen o
their o
mutual o
benefits o
and o
cooperation o
in o
the o
field o
of o
economy o
, o
open o
up o
to o
each o
other o
, o
eliminate o
inequalities o
and o
discriminatory o
policies o
in o
economic o
and o
trade o
transactions o
, o
gradually o
narrow o
the o
development o
gaps o
between o
countries o
and o
strive o
for o
joint o
prosperity o
is o
the o
economic o
basis o
for o
global o
and o
regional o
security o
. o

That o
all o
countries o
promote o
mutual o
understanding o
and o
trust o
through o
dialogue o
and o
cooperation o
, o
and o
promise o
to o
settle o
disputes o
and o
conflicts o
between o
countries o
in o
peaceful o
ways o
is o
a o
realistic o
way o
to o
ensure o
peace o
and o
security o
. o

This o
year o
some o
countries o
in o
eastern o
Asia B-LOC
encountered o
financial o
turmoil o
and o
have o
had o
some o
difficulties o
in o
their o
economic o
development o
, o
but o
the o
economic o
basis o
of o
east o
Asian o
countries o
is o
still o
good o
and o
advantageous o
factors o
for o
economic o
development o
still o
exist o
. o

In o
the o
course o
of o
this o
meeting o
, o
leaders o
of o
east o
Asian o
countries o
unanimously o
supported o
the o
suggestion o
to o
expand o
local o
trade o
and o
investment o
. o

It o
is o
believed o
that o
after o
reviewing o
experience o
and o
implementing o
proper o
adjustments o
, o
the o
economy o
of o
eastern o
Asia B-LOC
will o
definitely o
continue o
to o
move o
forward o
in o
development o
. o

The o
east o
Asian o
countries o
are o
not o
entirely o
without o
conflicts o
and o
disputes o
. o

But o
in o
order o
to o
safeguard o
fundamental o
benefits o
to o
the o
people o
of o
all o
east o

countries o
, o
and o
to o
promote o
the o
lofty o
cause o
of o

principles o
of o

also o
made o
a o
comment o
on o
the o
fact o
that o
beginning o
this o

, o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
authorities o
continued o
to o
practice o
the o
so o
- o
called o
" o
practical o
diplomacy o
" o
, o
advocated o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
a o
so o
- o
called o
" o
independent o
sovereign o
state o
" o
, o
and o
actively o
set o
up o
obstacles o
in o
the o
negotiations o
between o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
straits o
. o

He o
said o
that o
accomplishing o
the o
complete o
unification o
of o
the o
motherland o
was o
the o
common o
wish o
of o
all o
the o
Chinese o
people o
throughout o
the o
country o
and o
abroad o
. o

Since o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
's I-GPE
return o
to o
the o
motherland o
, o
relations o
between o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
straits o
has o
drawn o
greater o
attention o
. o

But o
the o
development o
of o
the o
separatist o
trend o
on o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
greatly o
hindering o
the o
process o
of o
peaceful o
reunification o
. o

Qichen B-PER
Qian I-PER
also o
pointed o
out o
that o
Chairman o
Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
seriously o
appealed o
again o
at o
the o
15th o
People B-ORG
's I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
that o
, o
as o
the o
first o
step o
, o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
Straits B-LOC
could o
negotiate o
on o
" o
formally o
concluding o
the o
hostile o
state o
between o
both o
sides o
under o
the o
principle o
of o
one o
China B-GPE
" o
and o
come o
to o
an o
agreement o
; o
and o
on o
this o
basis o
we o
could o
take o
up o
obligations o
together o
, o
maintain o
the o
integrity o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
sovereignty o
and o
territory o
, o
and o
plan o
out o
the o
development o
of o
relations o
between o
both o
sides o
. o

We o
hope o
Taiwanese o
authorities o
conform o
to o
the o
historical o
development o

, o
and o
take o
opportunities o
to o
make o

points o
out o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
authorities o
say o
that o
" o
do o
n't o
rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
is o
to o
restrict o
large o
- o
sized o
Taiwan B-GPE
companies o
from o
going o
to o
China B-GPE
's o
mainland o
to o
invest o
and o
would o
have o
no o
impact o
on o
medium o
- o
and o
small o
- o
sized o
companies o
, o
but o
this o
is o
actually o
not o
the o
case o
. o

Currently o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
authorities o
define o
medium o
- o
and o
small o
- o
sized o
companies o
as o
having o
capital o
of o
under o
60 o
million o
Taiwan o
dollars o
, o
but o
actually o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
current o
medium o
- o
and o
small o
- o
sized o
companies o
mostly o
have o
significant o
scale o
. o

Taking o
medium o
and o
small o
- o
sized o
companies o
listed o
last o
year o
as o
top o
ten o
for o
example o
, o
the o
smallest o
net o
operating o
revenue o
of o
these o
was o
3.365 o
billion o
Taiwan o
dollars o
, o
the o
highest o
reached o
10 o
billion o
Taiwan o
dollars o
. o

Obviously o
, o
implementing o
a o
" o
do o
n't o
rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
policy o
will o
result o
in o
losing o
many o
business o
opportunities o
in o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
for o
no o
reason o
. o

Jiaju B-PER
Hou I-PER
believed o
that o
the o
" o
do o
n't o
rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
policy o
would o
also o
have o
influence o
on o
exports o
to o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
. o

Because o
, o
among o
exports o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
, o
a o
large o
portion o
are o
due o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
businessmen o
investing o
in o
setting o
up o
factories o
in o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
and o
needing o
to o
ship o
spare o
parts o
for o
machines o
and o
equipment o
and o
intermediate o
raw o
materials o
. o

In o
recent o
years o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
trade o
surplus o
with o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
has o
accumulatively o
reached o
80 o
billion o
US o
dollars o
, o
which o
is o
almost o
the o
same o
as o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
foreign o
currency o
reserve o
. o

While o
the o
financial o
storm o
shows o
no o
sign o
of o
relief o
today o
, o
the o
importance o
of o
this o
surplus o
is o
more o
and o
more o
obvious o
. o

How o
can o
Taiwan B-GPE
decrease o
exports o
to o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
for o
the o
sake o
of o
" o
do o
n't o
rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
? o

Because o
this o
will o
reduce o
its o
trade o
surplus o
with o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
. o

Jiaju B-PER
Hou I-PER
pointed o
out o
that o
the o
" o
do o
n't o
rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
policy o
would o
also o
restrain o
foreign o
businessmen o
from o
investing o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Because o
most o
foreign o
businessmen o
investing o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
want o
to o
take o
this o
opportunity o
to o
jointly o
invest o
in o
our o
country o
's o
mainland o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
investments o
. o

Therefore o
, o
this o
policy o
, o
while o
blocking o
the o
development o
of o
local o
enterprises o
, o
will o
also o
limit o
foreign o
businessmen o
's o
wishes o
to o
invest o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

It o
is o
reported o
that o
Jiaju B-PER
Hou I-PER
has o
successively o
published o
3 o
articles o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
newspapers o
on o
the o
" o
do o

rush o
, o
be o
patient o
" o
policy o
, o
pointing o
out o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
authorities o
that o
this o
erroneous o
mainland o
economic o
and o
trade o
policy o
violates o
the o
" o
basic o
philosophy o
of o
free o
economy o
" o
, o
and o
hopes o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
authorities o
" o
are o
warned o
of o
the o

will o
become o
the o
main o
theme o
of o
this o
year o
's o
economic o
development o
. o

Official o
authorities o
revealed o
that o
this o
year o
the o
Chinese o
government o
determined o
that o
the o
economic o
growth o
rate o
was o
8 o
% o
and o
price o
levels o
will o
be o
controlled o
within o
3 o
% o
. o

This o
means o
that o
the o
whole o

operation o
situation o
will o
maintain o
a o
healthy o
pattern o
of o
" o
high o
growth o
and o
low o

" o
. o

People o
in o
economic o
circles o
seem o
to o
be o
more o
optimistic o
about o
the o
economic o
outlook o
. o

The o
growth o
rate o
, o
predicted o
by o
concerned o
experts o
of o
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Planning I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, o
the B-ORG
Statistical I-ORG

, o
is o

Of o

, o
to o
a o
relatively o

, o
this o

Moreover o
, o
the o
impact o
of o

, o
the o
keynote o
of o
a o
moderately o
tight o

policy o
will o

The o
key o
of o
the o
current o
economy o
is o
not o
striving o
for o
a o
higher o
growth o
rate o
, o
but o
is o
adjusting o
structures o
and o
increasing o
benefits o
so o
as o
to o
make o
macro o
controls o
which o
were o
implemented o
from o
the o
second o
half o
year o
of o
1993 o
obtain o
greater o
achievements o
and o
push o
the o
national o
economy o
onto o
a o
road o
of o
constant o
, o
rapid o
and o
healthy o
development o
. o

Actually o
, o
as o
main o
obstacles o
that o
restrained o
economic o
growth o
in o
the o
past o
several o
years o
-- o
inflation o
and o
the o
" o
bottleneck o
" o
of o
basic o
industries o
have o
all o
been o
evidently o
relieved o
and o
the o
macro-economic o
situation o
tends o
to o
loosen o
, o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
development o
is o
in o
a o
relatively o
favorable o
period o
. o

This o
year o
, o
China B-GPE
plans o
to o
create o
an o
effective o
pulling o
force o
to o
economic o
growth o
through o
maintaining o
a o
moderate o
and o
stable o
growth o
of o
investment o
, o
consumption o
and o
exports o
. o

Fixed o
assets o
investments o
will o
grow o
by o
10 o
% o
this o
year o
, o
total o
volumes o
of o
retail o
sales o
of o
social o
consumer o
products o
by o
10 o
% o
and o
export o
growth o
by o
8 o
% o
. o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
the o
financial o
deficit o
will o
be o
reduced o
by o
10 o
billion o
yuan o
. o

After o
bidding o
farewell o
to o
the o
age o
of o
" o
the o
shortage o
economy o
" o
, o
relations o
between o
commodity o
's o
supply o
and o
demand o
have o
changed o
from o
a o
" o
buyers o
' o
market o
" o
to o
an o
integrated o
" o
sellers o
' o
market o
" o
and o
competition o
will o
be o
intensified o
. o

Hence o
, o
activating o
the o
consumer o
market o
, o
especially o
the o
wide o
rural o
market o
, o
cultivating o
consumer o
hotspots o
and o
new o
economic o
growth o
points o
appear o
to o
be o
particularly o
urgent o
. o

Along o
with o
comprehensively o
implementing o
hardship o
relief o
measures o
taken o
towards o
large o
and o
medium o
- o
sized o
State B-ORG
owned o
enterprises o
, o
the o
pace o
of o
State B-ORG
owned o
enterprise o
reforms o
will o
be o
accelerated o
greatly o
, o
the o
dynamics o
of o
bankruptcies o
, o
mergers o
and o
assets o
restructuring o
will o
be o
strengthened o
, o
and o
enterprise o
deficits o
are o
estimated o
to o
decrease o
by o
20 o
% o
and o
a o
number o
of o
competitive o
large o
and o
medium o
- o
sized o
State B-ORG
owned o
enterprises o
will o
gradually o
form o
. o

However o
, o
the o
large o
amount o
of o
worker o
layoffs o
that o
will o
accompany o
this o
will o
cause o
unemployment o
pressure o
to o
gradually o
increase o
. o

China B-GPE
has o
determined o
to o
appropriately o
place o
laid o
- o
off o
workers o
and o
to o
strive o
to o
control o
the o
unemployment o
rate o
to o
within o
3.5 o
% o
through o
implementation o
of o
a o
large o
scale o
" o
re-employment o
" o
project o
. o

According o
to o
estimates o
, o
after o
three o
years o
in o
a o
row o
of o
bumper o
harvests o
, o
if o
this o
year o
's o
measures o
are o
effective o
, o
agriculture o
still o
has o
hope o
of o
achieving o
a o
good o
harvest o
. o

Agriculture o
's o
increasing o
production o
and o
peasants o
' o
increasing o
revenues o
will o
create o
favorable o
conditions o
for o
inhibiting o
commodity o
prices o
and o
realizing o
the o
target o
of o
steady o
economic o
development o
. o

Currently o
, o
the o
degree o
of o
dependence o
on o
the o
outside o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
economy o
has o
reached o
42 o
% o
, o
and o
the o
space o
of o
utilizing o
overseas o
markets o
and o
resources o
is o
in o
the o
process o
of o
expanding o
, o
but o
is o
more o
easily o
subject o
to o
the o
influences o
of o
the o
international o
environment o
. o

Under o
the o
circumstances o
of o
a o
relative o
steady o
domestic o
demand o
, o
the o
pulling o
effect o
of o
the o
trend o
of o
foreign o
trade o
towards o
economic o
development o
is o
more o
striking o
. o

Taking o
all o
factors o
as o
a o
whole o
, o
this o
year o
's o
amount o
of o
foreign o
trade o
will o
be o
increased o
steadily o
, o
the o
import o
will o
be o
increased o
and o
the o
increasing o
speed o
of o
the o
export o
will o
be o
somewhat o
slowed o
down o
. o

People o
in o
economic o
circles o
said o
that o
China B-GPE
should o
adopt o
positive o
and o
steady o
measures o
to o
solve o
outstanding o
problems o
in o
economic o
operations o
, o
and o
special o
attention o
should o
be o
given o
to o
clear o
up o
bad o
assets o
in o
time o
and o
strengthen o
financial o
risk o
prevention o
. o

Forecasting o
the o
Year o
of o
the o
Tiger o
, o
although o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
train o
will o
have o
ups o
and o
downs o

as o
long o
as o
adjusted o

measures o
are o
at o
the o

, o
it o

made o
a o
report o
concerning o
the o

's o
world o
economic o
and o
financial o
situation o
. o

After o
he o
reviewed o
the o
world o
economic o
and o
financial o
situation o
of o
'97 o
, o
he o
said o
that o
due o
to o
the o
economic o
growth o
in o
Asia B-LOC
, o
including o
Japan B-GPE
, o
further o
slowing o
down o
, o
the o
economic o
growth o
of o
America B-GPE
, o
even o
though o
its o
current o
economic o
activity o
is o
relatively o
good o
, o
and o
of o
other o
countries o
will o
also o
feel o
a o
very o
large o
effect o
. o

Compared o
with o
the o
rapid o
growth o
of o
the o
past o
, o
the o
world o
economy o
has o
entered o
a o
period o
of o
adjustment o
. o

He o
forecast o
that o
the o
real o
growth o
rate o
for o
the o
world o
economy o
this o
year o
would o
fall o
from o
the o
3.9 o
% o
of o
'97 o
down o
to o
3 o
% o
. o

Nakamura B-PER
thought o
that o
the o
rate o
of o
economic o
growth o
of o
Asia B-LOC
's o
countries o
and o
regions o
, o
with o
Korea B-GPE
and o
Thailand B-GPE
being o
the o
most o
prominent o
, o
would o
slide o
downward o
to o
a o
large o
extent o
. o

But o
, o
he o
said o
, o
for o
these o
countries o
the o
currencies o
already o
have o
devalued o
to o
a o
great o
degree o
, o
exports o
have o
recovered o
, o
and o
imports o
could o
decrease o
. o

Because o
of o
this o
, o
he o
expected o
that o
their o
economies o
would o
slip o
downward o
to o
the o
lowest o
point o
in o
the o
next o
half o
year o
. o

He o
estimated o
that o
the o
rate o
of o
economic o
growth o
in o
ASEAN B-ORG
would o
be o
about o
4.5 o
percent o
. o

Nakamura B-PER
said o
that o
the o
Japanese o
economy o
exhibited o
negative o
growth o
in o
the o
year o
'97 o
, o
and o
that o
in o
'98 o
, o
if o
it o
did o
n't o
adopt o
good o
economic o
policies o
, o
the o
economy o
would o
continue o
to o
be o
in o
negative o
growth o
. o

He o
estimated o
it o
would o
be o
negative o
0.5 o
percent o
, o
plus o
or o
minus o
. o

He o
said o
further o
that o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
growth o
would o
also o
slow o
in o
speed o
, o
feeling o
the o
effects o
of o
the o
economies o
of o
Japan B-GPE
and o
Asia B-LOC
being o
depressed o
and o
of o
the o
devaluation o
of o
these o
countries o
' o
currencies o
. o

But o
because o
China B-GPE
's o
usual o
income o
and o
expenditures o
show o
a o
favorable o
balance o
, o
and o
in o
addition o
it o
has o
over o
100 o
billion o
US o
dollars o
in o
foreign o
exchange o
reserves o
, o
it o
is o
n't o
likely o
to o
sink o
into o
the o
crisis o
like o
the o
other o
Asian o
nations o

Asia I-LOC
undoubtedly o
will o
have o

also o
revealed o
that o
, o
henceforth o
, o
in o
the o
area o
of o
overseas o
debt o
issuance o
, o
we o
will o
implement o
policy o
re-adjustments o
and o
improvements o
in o
three o
areas o
. o

First o
, o
debt o
issuance o
bodies o
will o
diversify o
. o

Besides o
insisting o
that o
financial o
institutions o
be o
the o
main o
foreign o

channels o
, o
there o
will o
be o
a o
few o
special o

- o
owned o
enterprises o
with o
good o
international o
reputations o
, o
with o

, o
that o
have o
good o
asset o
- o
to o

, o
and o
good o
benefits o
, o
that o
enter o
the o
international o
capital o
market o
to o
implement o
debt o
issuance o
. o

Second o
, o
bond o
structures o
will o
diversify o
. o

After o
three o
years o
of o
experimentation o
, o
issuance o
methods o
and o
features o
of o
transferable o
bonds o
are o
accepted o
domestically o
. o

Henceforth o
, o
the o
main o

to o
their o
characteristics o

bonds o
, o
ABS o
, o
etc. o
, o
that o
have o
no o
recall o
or o
limited o

, o
thereby o
reducing o
the o
pressure o
of o
financial o
institutions o
in o
foreign o
lending o
and o

to o
become o
international o
, o
to o
become o
scientific o

and o
to o
become o

In o

, o
we o

type o
of o

method o
with o
international o
benefits o
, o
reduce o
costs o
of o
our o
overall o
financing o
and o
reduce o
our o
financial o
risks o
. o

Third o
, o
we o
will o
confirm o
the o
qualifications o
of o
overseas o
issuance o
bodies o
, o
completing o
the o
transition o
process o
from o

Wanpeng B-PER

said o
that o
conditions o
for o
the o
textile o
industry o
to o
cast o
off o
its o
predicament o
basically o
exist o
. o

China B-GPE
has o
issued o
a o
series o
of o
powerful o
policies o
and o
measures o
for o
the o
textile o
industry o
to o
make o
up o
losses o
and o
solve o
problems o
. o

A o
large o
number o
of o
cadres o
and o
workers o
of o
the o

have o
already o
realized o
the o
seriousness o
of o
the o
difficulties o
they o
face o
, o
and o
the o
pressing o
need o
to o
make o
up o
losses o
and o
solve o
problems o
. o

The o
solution o
not o
only o
concerns o
their o
survival o
and o
development o
but o
also o
has o
far o
reaching o
effects o
on o
the o
overall o
situation o
of o
the o
development o
and o
stability o
of o
the o
whole o
state o

economy o
. o

In o
recent o
years o
, o
the o
textile o
industry o
in o
China B-GPE
faced o
serious o
difficulties o
. o

The o
state o
- o
owned o
textile o
industry o
has o
incurred o
losses o
consecutively o
for o
five o
years o
. o

1996 o

1997 o
has o
an o

, o
involving o
1.8 o

as o
82 o
% o
, o
all o
ranking o

The o
problems o
reflected o

the o
difficulties o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
textile o
industry o
are o
very o
representative o
among o

are o
: o
low o

construction o
really o
standing o
out o
, o
historical o
burdens o
weighing o
down o
, o
and o
surplus o

excessive o
. o

If o
the o
textile o
industry o
where o
difficulties o
are o
most o
serious o
and o
conflicts o
are o
most o
concentrated o
can o
emphatically o
break o
through o
, o
and o
take o
the o
lead o
in o
reversing o
the o
difficult o
situation o
, o
it o
will o
provide o
experience o
for o
other o
industries o
, o
and o
strengthen o
confidence o
and o
determination o
in o
resolving o
problems o
. o

Wanpeng B-PER

in o
the o

industry o
, o
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
and o

departments o
have o
successively o
determined o
a o
series o
of o
powerful o

measures o
. o

Firstly o
, o
in o

to o
do o
well o
in o
the o
work o
of o
reducing o
and o
eliminating o
outdated o
spindles o
, o
subsidies o
of o
3 o
million o

will o
be o

" o
, o
announced o

Office I-ORG
today o
, o
pointed o
out o
that o
the o
unreasonableness o
of o
trade o
statistics o
determined o
according o
to o
the o
original o
site o
of o
manufacture o
principle o
was o
where o
the o
essence o
lay o
in o
America B-GPE
's o
trade o
deficit o
with o
China B-GPE
being o
seriously o
exaggerated o
, o
and o
in o
the o
Sino o
- o
American o
trade o
balance o
situation o
being o
distorted o
. o

The o
White o
Paper o
said o
that o
because o
of o
a o
lack o
of o
unified o
original o
production o
site o
rules o
, o
each o
country o
, o
when o
formulating o
its o
own o
original o
production o
site o
rule o
, o
often o
starts o
out o
from o
the o
needs o
of o
its o
own o
country o
, o
and o
standards o
differ o
, o
degrees o
of o
strictness o
vary o
, o
and o
randomness o
sometimes o
exists o
in o
assessing o
the o
original o
production o
site o
of o
imported o
goods o
. o

The o
White o
Paper o
said o
that o
now o
, o
because o
economic o
trade o
relationships o
among o
countries o
in o
the o
world o
develop o
rapidly o
, o
cross-national o
investments o
increase o
daily o
, o
exchanges o
in o
international o
trade o
are o
no o
longer o
goods o
produced o
in o
an o
individual o
country o
, o
but o
" o
world o
products o
" o
crossing o
national o
boundaries o
. o

Methods o
of o
calculating o
export o
trade o
according o
to o
current o
original o
production o
sites o
, o
make o
it o
obviously o
difficult o
to o
accurately o
reflect o
general o
trends o
in o
changes o
in o
world o
economic o
development o
. o

It o
could o
even o
distort o
the o
balance o
of o
trade o
situation o
among o
countries o
. o

In o
the o
past o
two o
to o
three o
decades o
, o
rapid o
development o
in o
the o
processing o
trade o
in o
some o
countries o
and o
regions o
had o
increased o
the o
complexity o
of o
this o
problem o
. o

The o
White o
Paper o
said o
, o
since o
the o
90's o
, o
one o
of o
the o
important o
ingredients o
of o
the o
growth o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
foreign o
trade o
exports o
was o
the o
expansion o
of o
processing o
trade o
exports o
. o

China B-GPE
's o
processing o
trade o
was o
mainly o
developed o
from o
the o
transfer o
of o
labor o
- o
intensive o
manufacturing o
industries o
or o
work o
processes o
from o
developed o
countries o
such o
as o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
Japan B-GPE
, o
etc. o
and o
countries o
and o
regions o
such o
as o
Singapore B-GPE
, o
Korea B-GPE
, o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
etc. o
, o
in o
order o
to o
reduce o
production o
costs o
and o
raise o
competitiveness o
. o

Its o
products o
rely o
on o
original o
sales o
channels o
, o
transferring o
from o
places o
like o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
, o
etc. o
to o
traditional o
markets o
such o
as o
the o
US B-GPE
etc o
. o

By o
original o
production o
site o
rule o
statistics o
, o
product o
exporting o
countries o
shifted o
from o
these o
countries o
and o
regions o
to o
China B-GPE
. o

The o
White o
Paper o
said o
that o
in o
recent o
years o
, o
two o
thirds o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
exports o
to o
the o
US B-GPE
were o
transferred o
out o
through o
the o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
region o
. o

These o
products o
' o
value o
- o
added o
rates o
in o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
are o
far o
higher o
than o
the o
value o
- o
added o
rates o
in o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
's I-GPE
actual o
benefits o
are o
far o
higher o
than o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

If o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
's I-GPE
larger o
value o
- o
added o
portions o
are o
counted o
as o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
's I-GPE
exports o
, o
then o
China B-GPE
's o
trade o
surplus o
with o
the o
US B-GPE
could o
correspondingly o
decrease o
, o
even o
becoming o
a o
deficit o
. o

The o
White o
Paper o
thereby o
drew o
the o
conclusion o
and o
held o
that o
, o
when o
using o
original o
production o
site o
statistics o
, o
its o
limitations o
must o
be o
fully o
recognized o
, o
superficial o
figures o
must o
be o
seen o
through o
, o
and o
the o
actual o
benefit o
that o
each o
party o
achieves o
from o
trade o
must o
be o
seriously o
analyzed o
. o

This o
will o
then o
help o
to o
eliminate o
misunderstanding o
, o
and o
appropriately o
solve o
trade o
disputes o
between o
countries o
. o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
one o
must o
also o
consider o
the o
increasingly o
growing o
trend o
of o
increasingly o
close o
international o
economic o
interaction o
and o
international o
investment o
, o
service o
trade o
, o

, o

that o
the o
reason o
why o
he o
had o
chosen o
to o
establish o
an o
office o
in o

is o
because o
the o
water o

land o

is o
convenient o
and o
the o
geographic o
location o
is o

all o
believe o
that o

an o
area o
with o

in o
many o
areas o
such o
as o
transportation o
, o

, o
agriculture o

, o
the o
cooperation o
between o

can o
not o

control o
the o
propagation o
of o

but o
can o
also o
kill o
mosquitoes o
. o

This o
method o
will o
not o

the o

Biologists o
mixed o
a o
mold o
element o
in o
the o
cells o
of o
plants o
with o
pearl o
powder o
to o
produce o
a o

of o

can o

feed o

they o
suck o
the o
mold o
element o
from o
the o

of o
plants o
into o
their o
bodies o

Experiments o
have o
shown o
that o

pointing o
out o
that o
sticking o
to o
principles o
of o

in o

in o

" I-ORG
, o
but o
also o
other o
newspapers o
, o

and o

have o
had o
such o
news o
. o

Although o
false o
news o
is o
rare o
, o
the o
influence o
is o
extremely o
bad o
. o

If o
there o
is o
one o

out o
of o

, o
readers o
will o
suspect o

The B-ORG
Chinese I-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party I-ORG
is o
a o
party o
that o
maintains o
the o
principle o
of o
being o
practical o

. o

Party o
journalism o
should o
also o
follow o
the o
principle o
of o
being o
practical o
and o
realistic o
. o

Regardless o
of o
whether o
you o
are o
a o
professional o
journalist o
or o
an o
amateur o
, o
regardless o
of o
whether o
reporting o
good o
news o
or o
reporting o
bad o
news o
, o
all o
of o
it o
needs o
to o
be o
true o
. o

There o
are o
a o
lot o
of o
reasons o
for o
causing o
news o
to o
be o
inconsistent o
with o
facts o
, o
most o
are o
subjective o
reasons o
. o

The B-ORG
" I-ORG
Hubei I-ORG
Daily I-ORG
" I-ORG
published o
that o
comrade o
's o
self o
- o
criticism o
. o

He o
said o
, o
" o
In o
order o
to o
get o
a o
good o
appraisal o
at o
the o
end o
of o
the o
year o
, o
I o
changed o
the o
time o
and o
place o
of o
incidents o
which o
happened o
or o
I o
had o
witnessed o
in o
the o
past o
, o
and o
fudged o
such o
scenarios o
as o
' o
the o
director o
general o
of o
revenue o
insists o
on o
giving o
Guofu B-PER
Ba I-PER
a o
reward o
of o
50 o
yuan o
' o
and o

Ba I-PER
's I-PER
child o
was o
ill o
and o
needed o

urgently o
' o
, o
etc o
. o
" o

His o
desire o
for o
being o
appraised o
well o
is o
understandable o
, o
but o
should o
have o
taken o
the o
right o
road o
. o

Moreover o
, o
press o
organizations o
should o
strictly o
check o
, o
and o
especially o
look o
out o
for o
those o
" o
related o
articles o
" o
. o

So o
, o
to o
punish o
false o
news o
, o
some o
practical o
measures o
must o
be o
taken o
, o
exposing o
it o
in o
the o
papers o
is o
very o
effective o
. o

False o
news o
can o
fool o
readers o
for o
a o
period o
of o
time o
, o
but o
eventually o
the o
writers o
fool o
themselves o

The o

Each o

its o
own o
superior o
achievements o
, o
which o
combine o
to o
make o
a o
brilliant o
and o
glorious o
calligraphy o
history o
. o

This o
is o
exactly o
why o
the o
Chinese o
art o
of o
calligraphy o
wins o
the o
strong o
admiration o
of o
friends o
from o
many o
countries o
of o
the o
world o
. o

American o
friends o
Mr. o
Sackler B-PER
and o
his o
wife o
, o
have o
wholeheartedly o
contributed o
a o
lot o
to o
carrying o
forward o
our o
art o
of o
calligraphy o
, o
and o
hope o
to o
introduce o
this o
brilliant o
art o
to o
the o
world o
, o
to o
let o
more o
friends o
learn o
and o
treasure o
it o
. o

We o
appreciate o
their o
absolute o
sincerity o

The o
first o
recently o

Sackler o
Cup o
Calligraphy o
Competition o
" o
selected o
, o
recommended o
and o
widely o
solicited o

treasures o
of o
recently o
budding o
calligraphers o
scattered o
in o
various o
places o
, o
and o
has o
been o
deeply o
welcomed o
by o
readers o
. o

In o
the o
appraisal o
and o
selection o
process o
, o
the o
standards o
we o
emphasized o
were o
: o
conforming o
to o
classical o
requirements o
of o
the o
Chinese o
art o
of o
calligraphy o
; o
healthy o
language o
diction o
, o
readable o

; o
certain o
standards o
of o
writing o
methods o
; o
solid o
skills o
, o
and o
self o
- o
establishing o
a o
new o
artistic o
concept o
-- o
these o
are o
the o
characteristics o
of o
our o
Chinese o
art o
of o
calligraphy o
, o
and o
because o
we o
have o
these o
characteristics o
, o
we o
won o
the o
attention o
of o
foreign o
friends o
. o

Therefore o
, o
any o

can o
follow o
tradition o
but o
not o
stagnate o
, o
and o
have o
new o
artistic o
concepts o
will o

In o

really o
beautifully o
written o
characters o
, o
conformed o
to o
a o
certain o
calligraphy o
style o
, o
and o
showed o
signs o
of o
new o
achievement o
in o
art o
form o
, o
but o
regretfully o
, o
because o
the o
calligraphers o
have o
poor o
basic o
knowledge o
, o
they o
wrote o
some o
wrong o
characters o
, o
and o
since o
there o
was o
no o
remedy o
, o
finally o
lost o
in o
the o
selection o
. o

Everyone o
both o
felt o
pity o
for o
them o
, o
and o
felt o
that o
this o
is o
an o
issue o
very o
worth o
worrying o
about o
. o

Some o
young o
calligraphy o
lovers o
, o
just o
at o
the o
time o
when o
they o
should o
have o
been o
studying o
hard o
, o
were o
hindered o
. o

So o
basic o
knowledge o
was o
not o
enough o
, o
structure o
was o
not o
systematic o
, o
and o
the o
level o
was o
rather o
low o
. o

They o
have o
some o
ability o
in o
calligraphy o
, o
but o
eventually o
can o
not o
produce o
a o
final o
masterpiece o
at o
a o
higher o
level o
, o
and o
can o
not o
create o
works o
which o
may o
be o
used o
as o
teaching o
models o
. o

We o
sincerely o
hope o
that o
these o
friends o
will o
amend o
this o
aspect o
quickly o
, o
and o
hope o
future o
works o
will o
show o
both o
superior o
capability o
in o
calligraphy o
, o
and o
convey o
healthy o
and o
deep o
thoughts o
, o
and o
even o
reveal o
a o
clear o
, o
meaningful o
and o
elegant o
mind o
. o

This o
is o
the o
eager o
expectation o
that o
many o
older o
- o
generation o
calligraphers o
have o
placed o
on o
us o
younger o
- o
generation o

but o
we o
still o
hope o
that o
this o

to o
the o

. o
" o

Yutaka B-PER
Kawashima I-PER
also o
suggested o
that o
the B-ORG
Universe I-ORG

Group I-ORG
organize o
an o
inspection o
team o
to o
thoroughly o
ascertain o
the o
reason o
why o
the o
satellite o
could o
not o
enter o
geosynchronous o
orbit o
. o

According o
to o
preliminary o
investigations o
by o
concerned o
parties o
, o
the o
cause o
of o
the o
failure o
was o
that o
the o
satellite o
's o
apogee o
engine o
was o
unable o
to o
normally o
operate o
because o
of o
a o
breakdown o
in o
the o
fuel o
valve o
. o

After o
the o
" o
Chrysanthemum o
- o
6 o
" o
satellite o
was o
sent o
into o
elliptical o
orbit o
by o
an o
" o
H2 o
- o
2 o
" o
rocket o
on o
the o
afternoon o
of o
August o
28th o
, o
it o
was o
originally o
planned o
to o
send o
it o
into o
geosynchronous o
orbit o
gradually o
by o
firing o
the o
satellite o
's o
apogee o
engine o
3 o
times o
, o
this o
interval o
requiring o
around o
1 o
month o
's o
time o
. o

However o
, o
the o
Japanese o
Universe B-ORG
Development I-ORG
Undertaking I-ORG
Group I-ORG
, o
which o
took o
responsibility o
for o
the o
launch o
, o
continued o
to o
remotely o
control o
the o
satellite o
on o
August o
30th o
and o
31st o
many o
times o
but o
suffered o
repeated o
failures o
. o

The o
" o
Chrysanthemum o
- o
6 o
" o
satellite o
, o
weighing o
2 o
tons o
and o
with o
a o
30 o
- o
meter o
- o
long o
board o
of o
solar o
powered o
batteries o
, o
is o
the o
biggest o
satellite o
ever o
launched o
by o
Japan B-GPE
so o
far o
. o

Moreover o
, o
this o
satellite o
is o
equipped o
with o
necessary o
electrical o
machinery o
and o
sensors o
. o

Japan B-GPE
originally o
planned o
to o
use o
it o
to o
conduct o
the o
world o
's o
first o
multimedia o
communication o
experiments o
, o
such o
as o
optical o
communication o
, o
etc o
. o

The o
Japanese o
Universe B-ORG
Development I-ORG
Undertaking I-ORG
Group I-ORG
believed o
that o
if o
this o
satellite o
's o
experiment o
was o
successful o
, o
Japan B-GPE
would o
henceforth o
enter o
an o
age o
of o
using o
large o
satellites o
like o
advanced o
countries o
in o
Europe B-LOC
and o

. o

Therefore o
, o
a o
sum o
of o
41.5 o

was o
put o
into o
the o
development o
of o
this o

Recently o

discovered o
a o

in o

This o
is o
another o
big o
discovery o
coming o
after o
an o
abundance o
of o
precious o
dinosaur o
eggs o
fossils o
were o
discovered o
here o
at o
the o
beginning o
of o
last o
year o
. o

This o
reporter o
has o
learnt o
from o
the B-ORG
Archaeological I-ORG

of I-ORG
Cultural I-ORG
Relics I-ORG
that o
at o
the o
beginning o
of o
April o
of o
this o
year o
, o
related o
experts o
discovered o
several o
hundred o
dinosaur o
bone o
fossils o
, o
including o
ribs o
, o
phalanges o
, o
etc. o
, o
between o
two o
river o

layers o
at o
such o
places o
as o
Hutou B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
, o
Yangcheng B-GPE
Township I-GPE
, I-GPE
Xixia I-GPE
county I-GPE
, o
etc o
. o

Because o
of o
long o
- o
term o
exposure o
at o
the o
ground o
's o
surface o
, o
some o
are o
already o
broken o
. o

From o
the o
view o
of o
stratigraphy o
, o
they o
all o
belong o
to o
the o
Cretaceous o
period o
. o

According o
to o
experts o
' o
judgment o
, o
a o
large o
quantity o
of o
dinosaurs o
fossils o
and o
other o
species o
' o
fossils o
are o
still o
buried o
within o
the o
dinosaur o
fossil o
group o
distribution o
area o
. o

They o
believe o
that o
the o
discovery o
of o
a o
large o
quantity o
of o
valuable o
dinosaur o
eggs o
fossils o
in o
the B-LOC
Xixia I-LOC

is o
an o
international o
rarity o
, o
and o
egg o
fossils o
and o
bone o
fossils o
existing o
in o
one o
place o
is o
even o
rarer o
. o

This o
find o
is o
of o
great o
important o
significance o
for o
studying o
dinosaur o
classification o
in o
the B-LOC
Xixia I-LOC
area I-LOC
, o
probing o

The o
discovery o
of o
the o
dinosaur o
bone o
fossils o
also o
provides o
important o
clues o
about o
the o

of o

years o

China B-GPE

said o
that o

I o
think o
that o
the o
people o
of o
the o
two o
countries o
, o
namely o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
are o
happy o
about o

Zemin B-PER

said o
to o
Russian o
reporters o
: o
" o
at o
the o
invitation o
of o
President o
Yeltsin B-GPE
, o
I o
will o
be o

Together o
with o
President o

Russian o
leaders o
, o
I o
will o
explore o
establishing o
friendly o
, o
neighborly o
and o
mutual o
, o
co-operative o
Sino o
- o
Russian o
relations o
that o
will o
extend o
into o
the o
21st o
century o
so o
as o
to o
raise o
the o
co-operation o
of o
the o
two o
countries o
in o
various o
areas o
to o
a o
new o
level o
. o

When o
a o
reporter o
asked o
whether o
the o
fact o
that o
now o
a o
large o
number o
of o
Chinese o
citizens o
overstay o
short o
- o
term o
visas o
after o
entering o
Russia B-GPE
will o
become o
a o
factor o
in o
tense o
relations o
between o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
and o
how o
this o
problem o
should o
be o
solved o
, o
Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
expressed o
that o
with o
the o
continuous o
development o
of o
friendly o
, o
neighborly o
relations o
between o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
in o
recent o
years o
, o
the o
two o
countries o
are o
no o
longer o
isolated o
from o
each o
other o
, o
and o
relations o
between o
them o
have o
expanded o
, o
with o
rapidly o
increasing o
staff o
contacts o
. o

This o
process o
is o
very o
natural o
. o

He o
said o
that o
" o
because o
necessary o
legislation o
and o
measures o
can o
not o
keep o
up o
with o
demands o
of o
the o
situation o
and o
development o
, o
certain o
phenomena o
of o
disorder o
occur o
, o
especially o
in o
contact o
at o
the o
border o
regions o
, o
resulting o
in o
some o
passive o
influences o
. o

We o
hold o
that o
this o
type o
of o
situation o
is o
not o
good o
and o
should o
be o
improved o
and o
stopped o
. o

In o
recent o
days o
, o
the o
situation o
has o
improved o
to o
a o
certain o
extent o
because o
both o
sides o
have o
co-operated o
in o
the o
adoption o
of o
some o
measures o
. o
" o

Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
said o
that o
" o
we o
should o
not o
' o
stop o
eating o
because o
of o
a o
hiccup o
' o
. o

I o
hold o
that o
this o
is o
a o
problem o
that o
appears o
while o
relations o
between o
the o
two o
countries o
are o
being o
developed o
, o
and o
that o
if o
both o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
take o
sincere o
, o
friendly o
, o
calm o
and o
realistic o
attitudes o
towards o
a o
joint o
effort o
, o
these o
problems o
can o
be o
solved o
appropriately o
, o
and o
that o
they o
are o
not o
, o
nor o
can o
they o
be o
factors o
of o
tense o

relations o

Speaking o
of o
the o
reason o
for o
the o
decrease o
in o
the o
volume o
of o
trade o
between o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
so o
far o
this o
year o
, o
Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
said o
that o
" o
We o
have o
noticed o
that o
compared o
to o
the o
same o
period o
last o
year o
, o
there o
is o
a o
drop o
in o
the o
volume o
of o
trade o
between o
the o
two o
countries o
, o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
, o
in o
the o
first o
half o
of o
this o
year o
. o

The o
reasons o
for o
the o
drop o
are o
manifold o
: o
both o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
are o
implementing o
economic o
reforms o
, o
and o
there o
are o
changes o
in o
demands o
for o
each o
other o
's o
goods o
; o
changes o
in o
the o
visa o
system o
have o
also o
brought o
some o
effects o
in o
contacts o
between o
traders o
of o
both o
sides o
. o

In o
international o
trade o
, o
increases o
and o
decreases o
in o
trade o
volume o
happen o
frequently o
. o

I o
believe o
that o
the o
drop o
in o
the o
volume o
of o
trade o
between o
China B-GPE
and o
Russia B-GPE
is o
only o
a o
temporary o
phenomenon o
. o

Through o
joint o
efforts o
of o
both o
sides o
in o
encouraging o
large o
, o
powerful o
and o
reputable o
companies o
from o
each o
country o
to o
develop o
co-operation o
, o
trade o
between o
both o
countries o
will o
develop o
even o
more o
healthily o
. o

There o
is o
no o
doubt o
that o
issues o
in o
this o
area o
will o
be o
within o
the o
scope o
of o
talks o
between o
the o
leaders o
of o
both o
countries o
. o
" o

When o
interviewed o
by o

, o
Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
said o
that o
" o
the o
situation o
in o
the o
development o
of o
relations o
between o
China B-GPE
and o
France B-GPE
has o
been o
very o
good o
since o
their o
normalization o
this o

now o
at o

of o

Mitterrand B-PER
I o
will o
be o
carrying o
out o
a o
visit o
to o
France B-GPE
for o
national o

. o

Trade o
relations o
between o
the o
two o
countries o
have o
also o
more o
quickly o
reached o
normalization o
and o
development o
. o

In o
the o
first o
half o
of o
this o
year o
, o
French o
exports o
to o
China B-GPE
increased o
by o
42.2 o
% o
compared o
with o
the o

period o
last o
year o

" o

Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
pointed o
out o
that o
China B-GPE

are o
strongly o
complementary o
to o
each o
other o
in o
economy o
, o
and o
that o
development o

are o
good o
. o

Both o
sides o
have o
quite o
a o
lot o
of o
identical o
or o
similar o
viewpoints o
on o
international o
issues o

He o
said o
that o

I o
believe o
that o

as o

's o
role o
, o
Zemin B-PER
Jiang I-PER
emphasized o
that o
there o
are o
two o
goals o
China B-GPE
is o
seeking o
on o
this o

: o
to o
maintain o
the o

to o
realize o
a o

He o
said o
that o
" o

resolution o
through o

When o

emphasized o
that o

Association I-ORG
director o

that o
the B-ORG

agreed o
in o

after o

The B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
holds o
that o
, o
now o
, o
both o
sides o
should o
first o
agree o
on o
topics o
and o
content o
of o
exchanging o
views o
, o
and o
then o
come o
back o
to o
consider o
issues o
such o
as o
staff o

time o

. o

If o

not o

and o
content o
, o
it o
would o
not o
be o

This o
type o
of o
discussion o
is o
not o
what o
compatriots o
from o
both o
sides o
are o
happy o
to o
see o
. o

The B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
believes o
that o
the o
content o
of o
the o
exchange o
of o
views o
should o
include o
: o

Firstly o
, o
to o
exchange o
views o
on o
the o
issues o
of o
tourism o
and o
contact o
on o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
Straits B-LOC
, o
including o
travel o
safety o
issues o
of o
compatriots o
from o
both o
sides o
. o

As o
early o
as o
the o
first o
working o
discussion o
, o
at o
the o
end o
of o
August o
of o
last o
year o
, o
when o
the o
two o
associations o
implemented o
the o
" o
Wang o
- o
Gu o
Talks o
" o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
put o
forward o
in o
the o
" o
schedule o
for o
the o
discussion o
on o
implementing o
relevant o
agreements o
of o
the o
Wang o
- o
Gu o
Talks o
" o
that o
the o
associations o
should o
conduct o
specific o
discussions o
about o
" o
issues o
on o
strengthening o
tourism o
and o
contact o
on o
both o
sides o
" o
as o
soon o
as o
possible o
, o
but o
so o
far o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
's I-ORG
response o
has o
not o
been o
received o
. o

Secondly o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
persistently o
advocates o
completely o
implementing o
discussions o
of o
topics o
about o
routine o
and o
economy o
, o
science o
and o
technology o
stipulated o
in o
the o
" o
common o
agreement o
of o
the o
Wang o
- o
Gu o
talks o
" o
, o
and o
has o
suggested o
many o
times o
to o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
that o
discussions o
on o
the o
" o
rights o
of o
Taiwanese o
merchants o
investing o
in o
the o
mainland o
and o
related o
issues o
" o
should o
be o
started o
early o
. o

Our o
association o
holds o
that o
the o
personal o
and o
property o
safety o
of o
Taiwanese o
merchants o
investing o
in o
the o
mainland o
have o
legal o
safeguards o
, o
and o
if o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
felt o
it o
was o
needed o
, o
it o
could o
exchange o
views o
while o
discussing o
" o
Rights o
of o
Taiwanese o
merchants o
investing o
in o
the o
mainland o
and o
related o
issues o
" o
. o

Thirdly o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
has o
repeatedly o
requested o
that o
both o
associations o
should o
conduct o
consultative o
discussions o
on o
issues o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
military o
killing o
and o
wounding o
mainland o
coastal o
fishermen o
and o
causing o
serious o
life o
and o
property o
losses o
in o
recent o
years o
. o

Since o
establishing o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, o
it o
has o
continuously o
pointed o
out o
such o
inhumane o
behavior o
to o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
which o
seriously o
hurts o
feelings o
of o
compatriots o
of o
both o
sides o
and o
breaks o
the o
harmonious o
atmosphere o
on o
both o
sides o
, o
so o
as o
to o
attract o
the o
attention o
of o
relevant o
Taiwanese o
areas o
on o
compensating o
for o
losses o
, o
finding o
those o
responsible o
, o
and o
severely o
punishing o
the o
assailants o
. o

It o
has o
appealed o
to o
stop o
such o
violence o
at o
the o
root o
through o
negotiation o
between o
the o
two o
associations o
. o

However o
, o
up o
to o
now o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
's I-ORG
response o
has o
not o
been o
received o
. o

The o
communique o
clearly o
points o
out o
that o
in o
the o
above o
issues o
involving o
rights o
of o
compatriots o
of o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
Straits B-LOC
in o
contact o
and o
exchange o
, o
personal o
safety o
is o
included o
, o
so o
as o
for o
the o
long o
delay o
in o
starting o
discussions o
, o
the o
fault o
is o
not o
with o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
. o

The o
communique o
says o
that o
current o
methods o
of o
contact o
and o
co-operation o
between o
the o
two o
associations o
must o
strictly o
follow o
the o
" o
regulation o
agreement o
of o
contact o
and o
talks o
between o
the o
two o
associations o
" o
signed o
last o
year o
. o

Since o
the o
" o
QianDao o
Lake o
Incident o
" o
occurred o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
has o
, o
according o
to o
the o
agreement o
, o
reported o
the o
situation o
to o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, o
explaining o
and o
answering o
a o
certain o
number o
of o
questions o
and o
requests o
brought o
up o
by o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
. o

However o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
has o
repeatedly o
raised o
demands o
that o
exceed o
the o
above o
agreement o
of o
the o
two o
associations o
. o

Despite o
being o
reminded o
by o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
still o
repeatedly o
persists o
. o

This o
is o
a o
practice o
that o
disrespects o
the o
agreement o
between o
the o
two o
associations o
. o

It o
is o
continually o
hoped o
that o
the o
contact o
and o
co-operation o
of o
the o
two o
associations o
can o
be o
conducted o
in o
accordance o
with o
the o
current o
agreement o
. o

The o
communique o
points o
out o
that o
as o
far o
as o
the o
" o
QianDao o
Lake o
Incident o
" o
is o
concerned o
, o
the o
top o
priority o
is o
investigating o
and o
settling o
the o
case o
in o
accordance o
with o
the o
law o
. o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
to o
express o
further o
goodwill o
, o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
has o
proactively o
invited o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
and o
relevant o
experts o
to o
come o
to o
Zhejiang B-GPE
. o

The B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Association I-ORG
will o
arrange o
experts o
' o
to o
be o

Chinese o

archaeopteryx o

type o
fossils o
in o
the o
Beipiao B-GPE
region o
of o

this o

This o

has o
attracted o
attention o
from o
home o

abroad o
, o
and o
has o
been o
called o
" o
one o
of o
the o
most o
important o
finds o
since o

were o
found o
in o
Germany B-GPE
in o
1862 o
" o
. o

In o

at o
the o
earliest o
finding o
of o
archaeopteryx o
in o
the o
state o
of o
Bavaria B-GPE
, I-GPE
Germany I-GPE
, o
it o
stirred o
the o
whole o

. o

Over o
the o

100 o

, o
the o

discovered o
altogether o
8 o
archaeopteryx o
findings o
from o

, o
and o
only o
confined o
to o
this o
area o
. o

However o
, o
the o
study o
of o
archaeopteryx o
has o
never o
stopped o
. o

Today o
, o
the o
archaeopteryx o
- o
type o
fossils o
China B-GPE
discovered o
are o
close o
to o
and o
similar o
in o
age o
, o
form o
and o
structure o
to o
Germany B-GPE
's o
archaeopteryx o
-- o
it o
was o
approximately o
142.5 o
million o
years o
or o
more o
ago o
and o
belonged o
to o
the o
Mesozoic o
Oxfordian o
. o

They o
are o
a o
rich o
source o
of o
material o
. o

There o
are o
not o
only o
completely o
preserved o
skulls o
and o
wings o
but o
also o
waist o
belts o
, o
back o
limbs o
and o
several o
feathers o
. o

Experts o
and o
scholars o
from o

are o
greatly o
focusing o
on o
this o
important o

, o

Relevant o
scholars o
in o
China B-GPE
's o
geology o
circles o
said o
that o
this o
discovery o
has o
added o
new o
evidence o
to o
determining o
geological o
ages o
. o

Chinese o
ornithological o
experts o
, o
however o
, o
think o
that o
this o
important o
find o
has o
very o
important o
significance o
in o
the o
study o
of o
the o
origin o
of o
birds o
and o
ancient o
biology o
research o
. o

It o
not o
only o
adds o
a o
new o
member o
to o
the o
ancient o
birds o
but o
also o
widens o
the o
geographical o
distribution o
of o
the o
earliest o
birds o
, o
especially o
, o
puts o
forth o
a o
new o
challenge o
to o
today o
's o
various o
hypotheses o
of o
the o
protracted o
debate o
on o
the o
origin o
of o
birds o
. o

According o
to o
information o
, o
China B-GPE
, o
in o
recent o
years o
, o
has o
successively o
discovered o
bird o
fossils o
from o
the o
early o
Mesozoic o
period o
in o
provinces o
such o
as o
Gansu B-GPE
, o
Hebei B-GPE
, o
Inner B-GPE
Mongolia I-GPE
, o
Liaoning B-GPE
, o
etc o
. o

This o
period o
was o
mostly o
in o
the o
early o
Cretaceous o
age o
. o

However o
, o
this o
find o
of o
archaeopteryx o
fossils o
are o
from o
a o
much o
earlier o
age o
, o
lower o
in o
stratus o
and o
more o
primitive o
in o
features o
than o
previously o
discovered o
archaeopteryx o
. o

In o
view o
of o
this o
, o
the o
world o
places o
hopes o
of o
tracing o
the o
more o
primitive o
and o
more o
ancient o
, o
true o
ancestor o
of o
birds o
in o
China B-GPE
, o
and o
Chinese o
scientists o
also o
expressed o
possibly o
discovering o
fossils o
of o
birds o
earlier o
than o
the o
archaeopteryx o
in o
China B-GPE
. o

According o
to o
another o
report o
, o
Chinese o
scientists o
have o
temporarily o
named o
this o
type o
of o
archaeopteryx o
fossil o
" o
the o
Divine o
Land o
Archaeopteryx o
" o
. o

Currently o
, o
they o
are o
performing o
further o
study o
on o
these o
fossils o

On o
September o
1st o
, o
1939 o
, o
Hitler B-PER
's o
army o
attacked o
Poland B-GPE
. o

It o
has o
just o
been o
55 o
years o
now o
since o
the o
Second o
World o
War o
II o
which o
brought o
great o
suffering o
to o
the o
people o
of o
Europe B-LOC
and o
the o
world o
. o

A o
total o
of o
four o
million o
people o
from o
European o
countries o
died o
in o
this o
war o
, o
including o
those o
from o
Germany B-GPE

Among o
them o
, o
the o
USSR B-GPE
made o
a o
great o
sacrifice o
in o
the o
war o
to o
win o
over o
German o
invaders o
. o

Its o
casualties o
were o
nearly o
28 o
million o
. o

Half o
a o
century o
has o
passed o
in o
a o

, o
with o
Europe B-LOC
experiencing o
hot o

, o
cold o
war o
, o
turmoil o
and o
tremendous o
changes o
. o

Currently o
, o
both o
the o
hot o
and o

wars o
have o
passed o
, o
but o
the o
end o
of o
turmoil o
and o
conflict o
is o
not o
yet o
to o
be o
seen o
. o

In o
the o
early o
period o
after o
the o
war o
, o
the o
four o
large o
countries o
, o
namely o
the o
USSR B-GPE
, o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
the o
UK B-GPE
and o
France B-GPE
, o
carved o
out o
their o
spheres o
of o
influence o
in o
accordance o
with o
the o
" o
Yalta o
agreement o
" o
, o
and o
occupied o
Germany B-GPE
and o
its o
capital o
by o
districts o
. o

The o
highest o
policy o
- o
making o
authorities o
in o

then o
were o
the B-ORG
" I-ORG
Control I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Allied I-ORG
States I-ORG
" I-ORG
. o

Henceforth o
, o
Germany B-GPE
was o
split o
up o
and o
in o
a o
powerless o
state o
for o
a o
long o
period o
. o

Not o
long o
after o
, o
the o
contest o
between o
the o
US B-GPE
and o
the o
USSR B-GPE
in o
Europe B-LOC
caused o
a o
split o
in o
the o
original o
anti-fascist o
coalition o
, o
resulting o
in o
German B-GPE
's o
division o
into o
two o
. o

On o
the o
western o
side o
, o
the o
US B-GPE
organized o
NATO B-ORG
and o
supported o
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
for o
the o
purpose o
of o
keeping o
the o
USSR B-GPE
" o
in o
check o
" o
; o
on o
the o
eastern o
side o
, o
the o
USSR B-GPE
organized o
the B-ORG
Warsaw I-ORG
Pact I-ORG
, o
and o
built o
up o
East B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
as o
the o
bridgehead o
against o
the o
West B-LOC
. o

Germany B-GPE
, o
being o
split o
up o
, o
became o
the o
frontline o
of o
the o
cold o
- o
war o
confrontation o
between o
the o
East B-LOC
and o
West B-LOC
. o

Henceforth o
, o
there o
has o
not o
been o
a o
single o
day o
of o
peace o
in o
the o
political o
situation o
of o
Europe B-LOC
, o
a o
crisis o
- o
ridden o
continent o
. o

But o
, o
since o
the o
start o
of o
1989 o
, o
a o
new o
turn o
has o
occurred o
in o
the o
European o
situation o
. o

Radical o
changes o
in o
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
, o
the o
re-unification o
of o
Germany B-GPE
, o
the o
dissolution o
of o
the B-ORG
Warsaw I-ORG
Pact I-ORG
and o
the o
disintegration o
of o
the o
USSR B-GPE
all o
occurred o
successively o
, o
causing o
difficulties o
in o
continuing o
the o
original o
" o
Yalta B-GPE
system o
" o
. o

In o
this o
great o
change o
, o
Germany B-GPE
became o
the o
largest o
beneficiary o
. o

The o
rise o
of o
a o
re-unified o
Germany B-GPE
has o
changed o
the o
proportion o
of o
strength o
in o
Europe B-LOC
, o
making o
the o
UK B-GPE
and o
France B-GPE
, o
which o
originally o
were o
large o
world o
powers o
, o
worry o
about o
dropping o
to o
second o
- o
class o
big o
countries o
. o

The o
US B-GPE
, o
the o
only o
superpower o
today o
, o
has o
recently o
started o
to o
regard o
Germany B-GPE
as o
a o
" o
partner o
in o
leadership o
" o
, o
encouraging o
it o
to o
" o
exercise o
a o
leadership o
role o
" o
in o
world o
politics o
. o

The o
reason o
is o
obvious o
: o
the o
US B-GPE
wants o
to o
make o
use o
of o
Germany B-GPE
's o
strength o
. o

A o
unified o
Germany B-GPE
is o
moving o
today o
from o
a o
large o
economic o
country o
to o
a o
large o
political o
country o
. o

Depending o
on o
its o
own o
tremendous o
strength o
, o
Germany B-GPE
is o
playing o
a o
leading o
role o
in o
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Union I-ORG
, o
and o
its o
role o
as o
a o
" o
giant o
" o
is o
obviously o
seen o
by o
common o
people o
. o

It o
spares o
no o
efforts o
in o
playing o
a o
" o
bridging o
role o
" o
between o
eastern o
and o
western o
Europe B-LOC
and o
participating o
in o
the o
" o
peacekeeping o
mission o
" o
under o
the o
banner o
of o
the B-ORG

. o

Currently o
, o
the o
historical o
post-war o
period o
is o
drawing o
to o
an o
end o
. o

But o
the o
lesson o
of o
blood o
and o
tears o
and o
the o
painful o
experience o
it o
left o
for o
later o

still o

Lockheed B-ORG

and o
Martin B-ORG
Company I-ORG
are o
additional o
participants o
in o
the o
growing o
trend o
of o
takeovers o
and o
mergers o
of o
US B-GPE
companies o
in o
the o
last o
few o
months o
. o

This o
trend o
has o
spread o
widely o
to o
pharmaceutical o
and o
medical o
instrument o
companies o
, o
telecommunication o
and o
high o
- o
tech o
companies o
as o
well o
as o
retail o
, o
banks o
and o
railway o
companies o
, o
etc o
. o

According o
to o
the o
statistics o
of o
" B-ORG
Time I-ORG
" I-ORG
magazine I-ORG
, o
from o
January o
to o
July o
this o
year o
, o
the o
asset o
value o
of o
takeovers o
announced o
by o
US B-GPE
companies o
was o
as o
high o
as o
171.6 o
billion o
US o
dollars o
increasing o
by o
about o
half o
over o
the o
same o
period o
last o
year o
. o

Within o
that o
, o
in o
the o
first o
7 o
months o
of o
this o
year o
, o
takeovers o
and o
mergers o
in o
total o
announced o
by o
four o
big o
US B-GPE
industries o
, o
medical o
treatment o
, o
media o
, o
telecommunications o
and o
banking o
, o
reached o
1062 o
, o
accounting o
for o
one o
fourth o
of o
all o
takeovers o
. o

Regardless o
of o
whether o
it o
is o
the o
number o
of o
takeover o
companies o
or o
the o
value o
of o
takeover o
assets o
, o
both o
exceeded o
or o
were o
close o
to o
the o
peak o
of o
US B-GPE
company o
takeovers o
in o
the o
late o
'80's o
. o

Observers o
here o
hold o
that o
since o
1994 o
, o
reasons o
for o
the o
US B-GPE
company o
takeover o
trend o
differ o
from o
those o
of o
the o
past o
. o

Firstly o
, o
the o
general o
trend o
of o
globalization o
of o
the o
world o
economy o
compels o
companies o
to o
expand o
scale o
and o
combine o
businesses o
, o
increase o
their o
overall o
competitive o
strength o
and o
to o
reduce o
costs o
. o

Secondly o
, o
the o
Clinton B-PER
government o
's o
thoughts o
and o
actions o
in o
constructing o
the o
information o
highway o
, o
adjusting o
the o
financial o
industry o
and o
reforming o
the o
medical o
insurance o
system o
compels o
related o
companies o
to o
make o
strategic o
adjustments o
. o

Moreover o
, o
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
's I-ORG
attitude o
towards o
anti-trust o
laws o
is o
somewhat o
more o
relaxed o
than o
before o
. o

Taking o
the o
pharmaceutical o
and o
medical o
equipment o
companies o
as o
an o
example o
, o
reforms o
of o
hospitals o
expanding o
scales o
of o
purchasing o
medicine o
and o
medical o
treatment o
equipment o
, o
and o
thus o
reducing o
unit o
costs o
and o
expanding o
services o
, o
have o
spread o
throughout o
the o
country o
. o

That o
the B-ORG
Columbia I-ORG
Medical I-ORG
Company I-ORG
purchased o
two o
hospital o
groups o
within o
one o
month o
last o
year o
, o
thus o
integrating o
pharmaceuticals o
, o
medical o
treatment o
and o
sales o
, o
is o
one o
such o
example o
. o

For o
telecommunications o
companies o
, o
the o
merger o
of o
telephone o
companies o
with o
cable o
TV o
and o
wireless o
communications o
companies o
frequently o
is o
to o
mutually o
complement o
one o
another o
in o
operations o
and o
to o
dominate o
the o
market o
. o

Recently o
, o
the o
US B-GPE
Congress B-ORG
passed o
an o
inter-state o
banking o
law o
, o
allowing o
regional o
banks o
to o
operate o
in o
other o
states o
. o

Handholding o
among o
banks o
is o
also o
to o
reduce o
overlapping o
services o
so o
as o
to o
reduce o
costs o
, o
to o
strengthen o
base o
assets o
, o
and o
expand o
credit o
scales o
. o

For o
military o
industry o
enterprises o
, o
the o
merger o
of o
Lockheed B-ORG
and o
Martin B-ORG
and o
the o
combination o
of o
two o
old o
- o
brand o
corporations o
, o
namely o
Northrop B-ORG
and o
Grumman B-ORG
, o
are o
both o
due o
to o
the o
same o
reason o
: o
after o
the o
cold o
war o
, o
the o
America B-GPE
's o
national o
defense o
expenditures o
gradually o
reduced o
, o
and o
the o
scale o
and o
strength o
of o
military o
industry o
enterprises o
is o
one o
of o
the o
conditions o
necessary o
for o
winning o
limited o
government o
weapons o
purchasing o
contracts o
. o

Observers o
here o
believe o
that o
company o
takeovers o
has o
a o
positive o
aspect o
, o
i.e. o
, o
the o
reduction o
of o
cost o
, o
the o
increase o
in o
efficiency o
, o
and o
the o
strengthening o
of o
competitive o
power o
. o

But o
, o
many o
takeovers o
are o
obviously o
actions o
that o
must o
be o
taken o
for o
companies o
to o
survive o
. o

However o
, o
history o
has o
proven o
that o
" o
big o
and o
complete o
" o
monopolies o
of o
production o
and o
sales o
is o
not o
beneficial o
to o
the o
national o
economy o
's o
healthy o
development o
. o

For o
instance o
, o
in o
the o
'70's o
, o
mergers o
of o
US B-GPE
steel o
mills o
directly o
led o
to o
the o
birth o
of o
a o
few o
large o
- o
scale o
unified o
steel o
companies o
, o
but o
these o
companies o
also o
faced o
serious o
threats o
from o
small o
- o
scale o
steel o
mills o
, o
which o
are o
flexible o
in o
operation o
and o
advanced o
in o
technology o
. o

Moreover o
, o
company o
takeovers o
have o
had o
bad o
effects o
on o
consumers o
in o
terms o
of o
product o
quality o
and o
price o
, o
and o
at o
the o
same o
time o
on o
workers o
' o
employment o
. o

While o
voice o
has o
been o
given o
to o
the o
opinion o
that o
small o
enterprises o
are o
the o
new o
forces o
of o
economic o
growth o
, o
scaled o
operation o
of o
big o
corporations o
will o
constantly o
face o
new o
difficulties o
. o

he o
again o

" o

Baglioni B-PER
has o
had o
a o
kind o
of o
preference o
for o
water o
since o
birth o

He o
said o
, o
" o
Water o
is o
a o
topic o

Water o

" o
Through o

, o
we o
come o
to o
understand o

Its o

came o
from o

little o

Although o
a o
small o
turtle o
is o
clumsy o
on o
the o

once o
in o

, o
it o

Around o

handover o
, o
questions o
that o
were o
hot o
in o
the o
Western o

were o
, o
What o
is o
" o
Macaense o
" o
? o

And o
what o
is o
native o
Macau B-GPE
culture o
? o

This o
is o
Carlos B-PER
Marreiros I-PER
's I-PER
story o
. o

The o
story o
began o
during o
the o
era o
of o
great o
sailing o
ships o
. o

Four o
hundred o
years o
ago o
, o
a o
Portuguese o
trading o
vessel o
dropped o
anchor o
off o
the o
island o
of o
Macau B-GPE
, o
intent o
on o
doing o
business o
with o
imperial o
China B-GPE
. o

That o
one o
brief o
rest o
stop o
destined o
Macau B-GPE
to o
become o
a o
cultural o
montage o
that o
includes o
Chinese o
, o
Indian o
, o
Malay o
, o
Portuguese o
and o
other o
European o
influences o
. o

Today o
, o
Macaense o
-LRB- o
or o
Macanese o
-RRB- o
, o
the o
free o
mix o
of o
the o
various o
ethnic o
currents o
of o
Macau B-GPE
has o
become o
the o
most o
vibrant o
element o
of o
its o
culture o
. o

" o
Without o

Ethnic o
melting o
pot o

Marreiros B-PER
is o
a o
typical o
Macanese o
. o

His o
grandfather o
was o
Portuguese o
, o
his o
grandmother o
Chinese o
. o

His o
mother o
has o
a o
mix o
of o
Spanish o
and o
Malay o
blood o
. o

In o
Macau B-GPE
, o
he o
's o
what o
is o
known o
as o
a o
" o
local o
Portuguese o
. o
" o

Marreiros B-PER
was o
born o
in o
Macau B-GPE
, o
but o
" o
most o
of o
my o
education o
took o
place o
in o
Europe B-LOC
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

He o
attended o
university o
in o
Lisbon B-GPE
, o
received o
his o
master o
's o
degree o
in o
Germany B-GPE
, o
and o
went o
on o
to o
study o
landscaping o
in o
Sweden B-GPE
. o

His o
principal o
impressions o
of o
China B-GPE
come o
from o
his o
family o
and o
his o
contacts o
with o
Chinese o
people o
. o

When o
he o
was o
young o
, o
Marreiros B-PER
worked o
in o
a o
Macau B-GPE
post o
office o
. o

One o
of o
his o
coworkers o
was o
a o
Chinese o
of o
the o
older o
generation o
, o
who o
often o
chatted o
with o
him o
about o
Tang o
- o
dynasty o
poetry o
, o
and o
Chinese o
proverbs o
and o
myths o
. o

For o
a o
while o
Marreiros B-PER
taught o
Chinese o
people o
how o
to o
speak o
Portuguese o
. o

" o
I o
learned o
quite o
a o
lot o
about o
the o
way o
many o
Chinese o
people o
think o
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

Carlos B-PER
Marreiros I-PER
speaks o
fluent o
Portuguese o
, o
Cantonese o
, o
English o
and o
German o
. o

He o
has o
done o
research o
on o
traditional o
Chinese o
poetry o
, o
and o
has o
included o
some o
in o
his o
Portuguese o
- o
language o
writings o
. o

He o
personally o
manifests o
a o
blend o
of o
Chinese o
and o
Western o
influences o
. o

Marreiros o
emphasizes o
that o
in o
addition o
to o
Chinese o
and o
Portuguese o
influences o
, o
Macau B-GPE
also o
has o
its o
own o
unique o
blend o
of o
culture o
- o
Macaense o
, o
which o
is o
exhibited o
in o
" o
local o
Portuguese o
" o
of o
mixed o
ancestry o
such o
as o
himself o
. o

" o
The o
world o
's o
first o
mixed-race o
culture o
appeared o
in o
Macau B-GPE
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

Now o
with o
the o
convenience o
of o
travel o
and o
transportation o
, o
the o
intermingling o
of o
black o
, o
white o
and o
yellow o
peoples o
is o
nothing o
new o
, o
but o
400 o
years o
ago o
, o
the o
people o
of o
Macau B-GPE
intertwined o
cultures o
from o
as o
far o
afield o
as o
India B-GPE
, o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
and o
Japan B-GPE
. o

Their o
influences o
can o
be o
seen o
everywhere o
in o
the o
cuisine o
, o
architecture o
and o
literature o
of o
Macau B-GPE
. o

Intellectual o
assets o

In o
the o
enclave o
's o
restaurants o
, o
such o
classic o
Macanese o
dishes o
as o
curry o
and o
Portuguese o
chicken o
are o
served o
up o
with o
a o
wide o
variety o
of o
seasonings o
, o
blending o
the o
sweet o
flavors o
of o
Cantonese o
dishes o
with o
the o
rich o
, o
tangy o
taste o
of o
old-style o
Indian o
fare o
. o

One o
example o
is o
Macanese o
baoguo o
, o
a o
combination o
of o
Chinese o
sausage o
, o
cabbage o
and o
tripe o
- o
not o
precisely o
Portuguese o
, o
nor o
Cantonese o
either o
. o

The o
exteriors o
of o
traditional o
Macau B-GPE
buildings o
are o
noticeably o
southern o
European o
in o
style o
. o

But o
Marreiros B-PER
, o
an o
architect o
, o
points o
out o
that o
while o
the o
outsides o
of o
many o
houses o
are o
European o
, o
the o
arrangement o
of o
rooms o
and o
furniture o
inside o
is o
often o
done o
in o
a o
Chinese o
manner o
. o

" o
The o
important o
space o
is o
given o
to o
the o
father o
and o
the o
eldest o
son o
. o

The o
remaining o
side o
rooms o
are o
for o
the o
ladies o
of o
the o
house o
and o
others o
- o
quite o
different o
from o
Portuguese o
architecture o
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

And o
the o
details o
of o
ornamentation o
, o
such o
as o
engravings o
, o
glasswork o
and o
wood o
carvings o
, o
are o
actually o
rendered o
in o
Qing o
- o
dynasty o
fashion o
. o

The o
most o
representative o
example o
is o
Macau B-GPE
's o
oldest o
church o
, o
Sao o
Paolo o
-LRB- o
the o
ruins o
of o
St. o
Paul o
's o
-RRB- o
. o

Its o
surviving o
stone o
facade o
is o
embellished o
with o
stone o
carvings o
not o
only o
of o
such o
Catholic o
images o
as o
angels o
and o
the B-PER
Virgin I-PER
Mary I-PER
, o
but o
also o
of o
dragon o
- o
and o
- o
phoenix o
motifs o
and o
fishing o
boats o
, o
as o
well o
as o
Catholic o
phrases o
written o
in o
Chinese o
characters o
. o

Marreiros B-PER
believes o
that o
the o
hybrid o
culture o
of o
Macau B-GPE
is o
its o
greatest o
asset o
. o

" o
Macau B-GPE
is o
so o
small o
. o

It o
has o
no o
land o
for o
industry o
or o
agriculture o
. o

All o
it o
has o
to o
rely o
on o
is o
intellect o
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

Three o
hundred o
years o
ago o
, o
missionaries o
in o
Macau B-GPE
built o
the o
first o
university o
in o

The o

according o
to o

A o
final o
version o
of o
Hsieh B-PER
's o
findings o
is o
to o
be o
provided o
to o

However o
, o
Chen B-PER
Pi I-PER
- I-PER
yun I-PER
provided o
no o
reasonable o
explanation o
of o
the o
key o
question o
: o
Why o
were o
public o
funds o
mixed o
up o
with o
and o
deposited o
along o
with o
private o
funds o
in o
the o
Soong B-PER
family o
's o
private o
accounts o
? o

Soong B-PER
, o
who o
participated o
in o
Hsieh B-PER
's o
press o
conference o
, o
then o
declared o
that o
the o
mixing o
of o
public o
and o
private o
funds o
was o
done o
on o
the o
orders o
of o
party o
chairman o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
for o
purposes o
of o
" o
security o
, o
reliability o
, o
secrecy o
, o
and o
avoiding o
trouble o
. o
" o

After o
the o
Hsieh B-PER
- I-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
Soong I-PER
press o
conference o
, o
the o
KMT B-ORG
held o
its o
own o
. o

Party o
spokesperson o
Huang B-PER
Hui I-PER
- I-PER
chen I-PER
said o
that o
the o
KMT B-ORG
had o
never o
officially o
authorized o
Soong B-PER
to o
have o
or o
use o
these o
funds o
, o
and o
that o
Soong B-PER
was o
suspected o
of o
embezzlement o
. o

A o
judicial o
investigation o
will o
be o
required o
to o
look o
into o
this o
. o

So o
how o
did o
all o
this o
start o
? o

On o
December o
9 o
legislator o
Yang B-PER
Chi I-PER
- I-PER
hsiung I-PER
held o
a o
press o
conference o
at o
which o
he o
stated o
that o
Soong B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
yuan I-PER
had o
opened o
a o
securities o
trading o
account o
at o
Chung B-ORG
Hsing I-ORG
Bills I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, o
that o
in o
December o
of o
1992 o
, o
Soong B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
yuan I-PER
purchased o
NT$ o
106 o
million o
in o
securities o
, o
and o
that o
as o
of o
the o
date o
of o
the o
press o
conference o
, o
there o
was o
more o
than o
NT$ o
140 o
million o
in o
securities o
in o
the o
account o
. o

Yang B-PER
wondered o
how o
Soong B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
yuan I-PER
, o
who o
had o
just o
graduated o
from o
university o
, o
could o
possess o
such o
a o
large o
amount o
of o
wealth o
. o

James B-PER
Soong I-PER
thereafter o
stated o
that o
after o
his o
son o
had o
gone o
abroad o
to o
study o
and o
start o
a o
business o
, o
a o
benevolent o
" o
elder o
" o
opened o
an o
account o
which o
would o
allow o
the o
younger o
Soong B-PER
to o
withdraw o
funds o
from o
the o
interest o
as o
needed o
. o

Over o
the o
years o
, o
there o
was o
no o
special o
need o
for o
the o
money o
, o
and o
last o
June o
NT$ o
140 o
million o
was o
returned o
. o

As o
for o
who o
this o
" o
elder o
" o
is o
, o
Soong B-PER
would o
not o
say o
. o

But o
scepticism o
persisted o
. o

On o
December o
15 o
, o
Soong B-PER
held o
a o
press o
conference o
at o
which o
he o
stated o
that o
the o
account o
in o
his o
son o
's o
name o
was o
set o
up o
under o
the o
direction o
of o
KMT B-ORG
party o
chairman o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
. o

He o
said o
that o
NT$ o
146,460,000 o
was o
transferred o
from o
the o
special o
account o
of o
the o
KMT B-ORG
Secretary o
- o
General o
and o
deposited o
in o
accounts o
under o
the o
names o
of o
Soong B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
yuan I-PER
and o
Chen B-PER
Pi I-PER
- I-PER
yun I-PER
. o

The o
money o
was o
designated o
, o
said o
Soong B-PER
, o
to o
take o
care o
of o
the o
descendants o
of o
former o
president o
Chiang B-PER
Ching I-PER
- I-PER
kuo I-PER
, o
and o
for o
" o
party o
tasks o
" o
specially o
designated o
by o
the o
chairman o
. o

Soong B-PER
said o
that o
the o
amounts o
announced o
by o
Yang B-PER
were o
inaccurate o
. o

Soong B-PER
held o
a o
second o
press o
conference o
on o
December o
18 o
. o

This o
time o
he o
declared o
only o
that o
the o
money o
had o
been o
intended o
for o
looking o
after o
the o
Chiang B-PER
family o
. o

On o
December o
21 o
, o
Legislator o
Yang B-PER
held o
his o
third o
press o
conference o
, o
in o
which o
he o
stated o
that o
Soong B-PER
's o
sister o
- o
in o
- o
law o
, o
Chen B-PER
Pi I-PER
- I-PER
yun I-PER
, o
had o
, o
in o
a o
half o
- o
month o
period o
at o
the o
end o
of o
1994 o
and o
the o
beginning o
of o
1995 o
, o
used o
NT$ o
470 o
million o
in o
cash o
to o
purchase o
bonds o
and o
securities o
at o
Chung B-ORG
Hsing I-ORG
. o

Under o
pressure o
from o
the o
public o
and o
legislators o
, o
on o
December o
22 o
Minister o
of o
Finance o
Chiu B-PER
announced o
partial o
results o
of o
their o
investigation o
, o
as o
mentioned o
above o
. o

This o
in o
turn o
sparked o
Soong B-PER
to o
ask o
Hsieh B-PER
Chi I-PER
- I-PER
ta I-PER
for o
another o
audit o
. o

There o
have o
been o
no o
firm o
conclusions o
as o
yet o
. o

The o
Chung o
Hsing o
case o
may o
or o
may o
not o
be o
fully o
clarified o
, o
but o
it o
has o
certainly o
greatly o
affected o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
's I-PER
public o
support o
. o

Before o
the o
scandal o
broke o
, o
he o
was o
getting o
more o
than o
30 o
% o
support o
in o
public o
opinion o
polls o
, o
but o
a o
December o
20 o
poll o
by o
the B-ORG
China I-ORG
Times I-ORG
shows o
Soong B-PER
with o
only o
23 o
% o
. o

This o
leaves o
him o
behind o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
-LRB- o
24 o
% o
-RRB- o
and o
barely o
ahead o
of o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
-LRB- o
22 o
% o
-RRB- o
. o

Yet o
, o
while o
Soong B-PER
's o
support o
has o
fallen o
, o
that o
of o
Chen B-PER
and o
Lien B-PER
has o
not o
markedly o
increased o
. o

Obviously o
former o
Soong B-PER
supporters o
are o
now o
taking o
a o
wait o
- o
and o
- o
see o
attitude o
. o

There o
's o
a o
final o
point o
worth o
reflecting o
on o
: o
This o
is o
only o
the o
second o
direct o
election o
for o
the o
president o
in o
the o
history o
of o
the o
ROC B-ORG
. o

Yet o
the o
personal o
characters o
of o
the o
candidates o
and o
those o
around o
them o
have o
already o
become o
the o
main o
focus o
of o
public o
attention o
. o

There o
's o
little o
discussion o
of o
public o
policy o
. o

For o
example o
, o
there o
's o
been o
virtually o
no o
response o
to o
the o
white o
papers o
on o
China B-GPE
policy o
and o
constitutional o
reform o
issued o
by o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
. o

What o
is o
wrong o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
democratic o
culture o
? o

Do o
the o
public o
and o
media o
need o
to o
reassess o
? o

After o
all o
, o
in o
the o
new o
millennium o
, o
there o
will o
be o
many o
more o
tests o
facing o
us o
. o

The o
Chung o

Case o
has o
seriously o
damaged o
the o
image o

Recently o
the o
8:00 o
p.m. o

being o
shown o
on o

in o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
shown o
a o
trend o
toward o

Three o
out o
of o
the o

It o

along o

are o
one o

the o
most o

and o
that o
they o

What o
then o
is o
the o
relationship o
between o
the o

of o

" o
- o
reflects o
one o
of o
the o
more o
common o
themes o
of o
TV o
shows o
done o
in o
Taiwanese o
. o

Beating o
of o
children o
, o
often o
by o
an o
evil o
stepmother o
, o
is o
not o
unusual o
. o

This o
is o
not o
because o
Taiwanese o
are o
especially o
firm o
believers o
in o
corporal o
punishment o
. o

Rather o
this o
kind o
of o
thing o
is o
a o
" o
trademark o
" o
that o
has o
become o
attached o
to o
Taiwanese o
drama o
over o
the o
course o
of o
its o
history o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
even o
though o
" o
nativist o
drama o
" o
has o
escaped o
the o
stereotypical o
setting o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
countryside o
of o
the o
past o
and o
increasingly o
focuses o
on o
contemporary o
urban o

to o
pull o
on o
the o
heart o

are o
still o
common o

" o
Taiwanese o
serials o
depict o
the o
daily o
life o
of o
ordinary o
people o
the o
way o
they o
do o
because o
of o

" o
And o
now o
, o
because o
of o
the o
trend o
in o
society o
of o
reviving o
Taiwanese o
as o
the o
mother o
tongue o
, o
Taiwanese o
drama o
has o
been o
able o
to o
leap o
into o
prime o

the o

The o
8:00 o

time o
slot o
has o
long o
been o
the o
flagship o
and o
leading o
money o
maker o
for o
television o
stations o
. o

For o
a o
program o
to o
get o
into o
this o
slot o
, o
besides o
being o
commercially o
viable o
, o
in o
the o
past o
it o
also o
had o
to o
be o
politically o
correct o
. o

This o
used o
to o
mean o
: o
" o
No o
use o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
language o
. o
" o

Because o
the o
government o
wanted o
to o
promote o
Mandarin o
, o
Taiwanese o
was o
officially o
seen o
as o
a o
rustic o
dialect o
, o
and o
was o
never o
eligible o
for o
prime o
time o
. o

The o
three o

- o
run o
television o
stations o
of o
that o
era o

-LRB- o
CTS o
-RRB- o
, o
and o
Taiwan B-ORG
Television I-ORG
-LRB- o
TTV o
-RRB- o
- o
had o
a o
tacit o
agreement o
that o
they o
would o
only o
show o
Taiwanese o
programs o
at o
noon o
or o
in o
the o
6:30 o
p.m. o
time o
slot o
, o
when o
most o
viewers o
would o
be o
housewives o
and o
elderly o
people o
. o

The o
programming o
for o
these o
time o
slots o
was o
low o
- o
budget o
, o
and o
the o
subject o
matter o
limited o
to o
ordinary o
life o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
unsophisticated o
rural o
past o
, o
mostly o
tragic o
tales o
of o
mistreated o
daughters o
- o
in o
- o
law o
and o
the o
like o
, o
or o
family o
comedies o
. o

Thus o
, o
for o
a o
long o
time o
, o
Taiwanese o
drama o
gave o
people o
the o
impression o
of o
being o
lowbrow o
. o

It o
was o
not o
until o
1990 o
, o
with o
the o
broadcasting o
of o
the o
series o
Love o
on o
CTS B-ORG
, o
that o
the o
prime o
- o
time o
language o
taboo o
was o
even o
partly o
challenged o
. o

This o
series o
also o
raised o
the o
quality o
of o
Taiwanese o
drama o
, o
and o
planted o
the o
seeds o
for o
future o
efforts o
. o

The o
show o
was o
set o
against o
the o
background o
of o
the o
August o
7th o
Flood o
of o
1959 o
. o

The o
story o
portrayed o
how o
some o
Taiwanese o
and o
mainlanders o
went o
from o
mutual o
misunderstanding o
to o
mutual o
forgiveness o
. o

The o
performers o
spoke o
in o
both o
Mandarin o
and o
Taiwanese o
. o

Because o
the o
language o
taboo o
has o
long o
carried o
heavy o
political o
undertones o
- o
the o
opposition o
has o
always o
preferred o
the o
use o
of o
Taiwanese o
, o
the o
ruling o
party o
has o
, o
until o
recently o
, o
almost o
exclusively o
favored o
Mandarin o
- o
the o
producers o
invited o
many o
people o
from o
the o
arts o
community o
to o
confirm o
that o
Taiwanese o
was o
essential o
for o
the o
program o
, o
so o
as o
to o
dispel o
the o
suspicions o
of o
those o
who o
would o
see o
political o
motives o
behind o
language o
choice o
. o

Unfortunately o
, o
the o
effort o
was o
less o
than o
a o
complete o
success o
. o

For o
one o
thing o
, o
stereotypes o
remained o
strong o
, o
and o
Love o
still o
retained o
many o
of o
the o
old o
traditions o
, o
being o
a o
tragic o
small o
family o
drama o
focusing o
on o
a o
young o
bride o
facing o
hard o
times o
after o
moving o
into o
the o
husband o
's o
home o
. o

Moreover o
, o
because o
of o
opposition o
from o
high o
officials o
at o
the o
television o
network o
, o
after o
several o
episodes o
, o
the o
performers o
who o
had o
previously o
spoken o
in o
Taiwanese o
had o
their o
dialogue o
changed o
to o
" o
Mandarin o
with o
a o
Taiwanese o
accent o
. o
" o

However o
, o
because o
the o
plot o
was o
realistic o
, o
ratings o
were o
unprecedented o
, o
and o
Love o
even o
defeated o
Widow o
's o
Watch o
, o
based o
on o
a o
novel o
by o
, o
and o
also o
produced o
by o
, o
the o
vastly o
popular o
romance o
writer o
Chiung B-PER
Yao I-PER
, o
and o
broadcast o
on o
CTV B-ORG
. o

At o
that o
time o
, o
many o
commentators o
suggested o
that o
Love o
was o
successful o
largely o
because o
of o
the o
use o
of o
Taiwanese o
. o

But o
Lin B-PER
Ling I-PER
- I-PER
ling I-PER
, o
a o
script o
writer o
for o
Widow o
's o
Watch o
, o
says o
that o
the o
real o
reason o
Love o
succeeded o
was o
because o
of o
its o
realistic o
depiction o
of o
the o
lives o
of o
Taiwanese o
. o

Her o
opinion o
is o
that o
" o
love o
stories o
involving o
constant o
hitting o
and o
screaming o
and o
dramatic o
twists o
and o
turns o
are o
not o
the o
stuff o
of o
real o
life o
, o
and o
Chiung B-PER
Yao I-PER
's I-PER
series o
departed o
too o
far o
from o
reality o
. o

This o
in o
fact o
has o
been o
a o
chronic o
problem o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
dramatic o
serials o
. o
" o

Love o
succeeded o
largely o
because o
it o
wedded o
realism o
to o
Taiwanese o
subject o
matter o
. o

Politics o
in o
command o
? o

However o
, o
though o
the o
series o
was o
popular o
, o
it o
did o
not o
immediately o
spark o
a o
wave o
of o
enthusiasm o
for o
Taiwanese o
subject o
matter o
. o

The o
government o
around o
that o
time o
adopted o
a o
policy o
of o
allowing o
producers o
to o
go o
to o
mainland o
China B-GPE
to o
film o
, o
and o
there o
was o
a o
sudden o
craze o
for o
martial o
arts o
series o
and o
love o
stories o
framed o
against o
a o
mainland o
backdrop o
. o

Still o
, o
television o
stations o
and o
producers o
had o
awakened o
to o
the o
existence o
of o
an o
audience o
for o
" o
nativist o
" o
Taiwanese o
drama o
. o

After o
the o

in o

, o

plummeted o
, o
and o
nativist o
stories o
using o
the o
Taiwanese o
language o
once o
again o
saw o
their o
star o
rising o
. o

This o
time o
they o
went o
right o
at o
major o
political o
taboos o
like o
the o
February o
28 o
Incident o
of o
1947 o

, o
ended o
up o

a o

around o
the o

Lin B-PER
explains o
: o
" o
I o
always o
want o
to o
write o
a o
Taiwanese o
drama o
against o
the o
backdrop o
of o
great o
events o
, o
and o
the o
February o

was o
at o
that o
time o
just o
beginning o
to o
get o
intensive o
open o

, o
so o
there o
was o
a o
lot o
of o
commercial o
viability o
as o

to o
the o

' o
popularity o
, o

become o
a o
major o
television o
star o

while o

her o

and o
has o
since o
gotten o

However o
, o
says o
Lin B-PER
with o
a o
laugh o
, o
things o
did o
n't o
go o
exactly o
as o
she o
expected o

" o
Because o
the o
writer o
, o

, o
and o
actors o
all o
had o
different o
political o
orientations o
, o
after o
the o
first o
several o
episodes o
which o
laid o
out o
the o
background o
of o
the o

, o
the o

, o
along o
the o
lines o
of o
the o

" o

The o
series o
was o
nonetheless o
a o

Taiwanese o
was o
no o

that o

have o

Linguistic o
and o
historical o
conditions o
politicized o
Taiwanese o
drama o
. o

There o
had o
always o
been o
controversy o
over o
it o

But o
the o
political o
significance o
faded o
, o
and o
, o
with o
the o
daughter o

in o
- o
law o
series o
beginning o
in o
1995 o
, o
Taiwanese o
drama o
became o
embroiled o
in o
a o
very o
different o
controversy o
- o
that o
it o
was o
oversimplified o
and o
stereotypical o

and o
that o
the o
clock o
had o
been o
turned o
back o
to o

of o

The o
story o
of o
The o
Astonishing o

ascribes o
the o
success o
of o
the o
daughter o

in o
- o
law o
series o
to o
several o
factors o
: o

" o
By o
playing o
on o
people o
's o
heart o
strings o
, o
using o
Taiwanese o
language o
, o
and o
being o
set o
against o
the o
background o
of o
that o
bitter o
era o
, o
the o
daughter o
- o
in o
- o
law o
series o
brought o
together o
all o
the o
traditional o
elements o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
drama o
, o
but o
in o
addition o
added o
new o
structure o
and o
packaging o
, o
and o
integrated o
the o
spiciness o
and o
conflict o
typical o
of o
an o
8:00 o
show o
. o

No o
wonder o
it o
was o
so o
successful o
. o

says o
that o
criticism o
of o
8:00 o
serials o
for o
being o
melodramatic o
is o
certainly o
not o
without o
foundation o
, o
yet o
, o
however o
people o
may o
criticize o
, o
there o
are o
still o
viewers o
who o
ca o
n't o
get o
enough o
. o

The o
audience o
is o
composed o
mainly o
of o
older o
folk o
and o
housewives o
. o

In o
general o
, o
they o
do o
n't o
want o
to o
watch o
something o
they o
have o
to o
really o
think o
too o
much o
about o
. o

The o
simpler o
the o
characters o
and o
the o
plot o
, o
and o
the o
more o
conflict o
there o
is o
, o
the o
better o
. o

Lin B-PER
adds o
that o
intellectuals o
criticize o
such o
shows o
but o
in o
fact o
do o
n't o
watch o
TV o
. o

Television o
stations o
have o
always o
based o
their o
decisions o
on o
ratings o
, o
and o
it o
is o
virtually o
impossible o
to o
expect o
that o
they o
will o
change o
a o
proven o
formula o
. o

" o
Rather o
than o
say o
that o
serials o
are o
a o
mirror o
of o
life o
, o
it o
would o
be o
better o
to o
say o
that o
people o
identify o
with o
the o
characters o
in o
these o
dramas o
even o
if o
their o
own o
lives o
are o
not o
as o
dramatic o
. o
" o

These o
are o
the o
terms o
used o
by o
Tsai B-PER
Yen I-PER
, o
a o
professor o
in o
the o
department o
of o
broadcasting o
and o
television o
at o
National B-ORG
Chengchi I-ORG
University I-ORG
. o

This o
is o
particularly o
the o
case o
for o
older o
people o
and o
housewives o
. o

According o
to o
Tsai B-PER
, o
the o
formula o
for o
success o
revolves o
around o
romance o
or o
family o
relations o
. o

For o
dramatic o
effect o
, o
there o
need o
to o
be o
elements o
of o
hatred o
or o
revenge o
, o
and o
usually o
one o
irredeemably o
evil o
character o
whose o
purpose o
is o
to o
create o
obstacles o
to o
the o
romantic o
or o
career o
success o
of o
the o
main o
character o
. o

The o
focus o
is o
extremely o
narrow o
- o
personal o
achievement o
. o

Social o
issues o
serve o
only o
as o
background o
or o
embellishment o
. o

The o
daughter o
- o
in o
- o
law o
series o
precisely o
fits o
this o
structure o
. o

Realistic o
fashion o

After o
the o
daughter o
- o
in o
- o
law o
series o
, o
there o
was o
a o
uniformity o
in o
dramatic o
serials o
all o
following o
the o
trend o
. o

Taiwanese o
drama o
went o
into o
a o
steady o
decline o
. o

However o
, o
just o
when o
things o
looked o
bleakest o
, o
nativist o
drama o
began o
to o
break o
out o
of o
its o
previous o
framework o
with o
the o
appearance o
of o
the o
" o
river o
of o
time o
" o
structure o
, o
characterized o
by o
a o
cross-generational o
story o
depicting o
long o
- o
term o
social o
evolution o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

This o
format o
incorporates o
the o
rural o
themes o
of o
traditional o
Taiwanese o
drama o
, o
but o
the o
stories o
evolve o
with o
time o
, o
and o
also o
portray o
modern o
urban o
life o
. o

Not o
only o
has o
this o
format o
given o
new o
life o
to o
Taiwanese o
drama o
, o
it o
has o
also o
pioneered o
an o
entirely o
new o
type o
of o
television o
drama o
- o
contemporary o
realism o
. o

Formosa B-ORG

had o
enthusiastic o
audiences o
for o

in o

The o

of o
actress o
Pai B-PER
Ping I-PER
- I-PER
ping I-PER
played o
against o
the o
stereotype o
of o
the o
abusive o
stepmother o
, o
instead o
being o
a o
woman o
who o
brings o
two o
of o
her o
own o
children o
into o
a o
marriage o
into o
a o
wealthy o
family o
. o

She o
has o
to o
deal o
on o
the o
one o
hand o
with o
the o
lack o
of o
understanding o
from o
her o
mother o
- o
in o

on o
the o

FTV B-ORG
seized o

has o

in o

the o

which o

a o

Fortune o

The o
story o
begins o
with o
the o

of o

A o

, o
she o
says o
- o
the o

" o

She o
finds o
this o
situation o
less o
than o

that o
in o

to o

up o
with o
the o
audience o
's o
ever o
- o
changing o
tastes o
, o
scripts o
are o
being o
rewritten o
right o
up o
to o
the o
last o
minute o
. o

Naturally o
television o
actors o
do o
not o
have o
the o
luxury o
that o
movie o
actors o
enjoy o
of o
allowing o
themselves o
time o
to o
slowly o
get o
in o
the o
right o
frame o
of o
mind o
for o
a o
role o
or o
scene o
, o
but o
even o
so o
, o
given o
the o
fact o
that o
TV o
actors o
must o
rely o
almost o
exclusively o
on o
dialogue o
and o
body o
language o
to o
keep o
the o
audience o
's o
attention o
, o
the o
fact o
that o
shooting o
is o
so o
hurried o
not o
only o
waters o
down o
the o
quality o
of o
the o
performance o
, o
there o
is o
little o
time o
even o
to o
get o
the o
lines o
right o
. o

Such o
conditions o
, o
she o
feels o
, o
make o
for o
productions o
that o
are o
really o
too o
rough o
around o
the o
edges o

Chou B-PER
You I-PER
, o
who o
has o
produced o
more o
than o
4,000 o
hours o
of o
dramatic o
series o
for o
television o
, o
says o
that o
prime o
time o
is o
like o
a o
battlefield o
for o
television o
stations o
. o

Sometimes o
the o
producer o
ca o
n't o
call o
the o
shots o
. o

Personally o
, o
she o
has o
always o
preferred o
to o
begin o
broadcasting o
only o
after o
the o
entire o
series o
has o
been o
completed o
, o
to o
ensure o
quality o
control o
. o

But o
if o
a o
series o
is o
doing o
well o
, o
the o
station o
will o
want o
to o
extend o
it o
, o
and o
if o
ratings o
are o
less o
than o
ideal o
, o
the o
series o
must o
be o
prepared o
to o
wrap o
up o
at o
any o

The o

that o

Even o

, o
the o
producer o
of o
Fortune o
is o
in o
Heaven o
's o
Hands o
, o
admits o
that o
ON B-ORG
programming I-ORG
is o
a o
real o
bottleneck o
for o
Taiwanese o
drama o
. o

But o
there o
is o
no o
quick o
- o
fix o
. o

With o
the o
practical o
environment o
being o
what o
it o
is o
, o
people o
will o
simply o
have o
to o
think o
their o
way o
out o
of o
its o
limitations o
. o

" o
ON B-ORG
programming I-ORG
is o
simply o
the o
way o
Taiwan o
television o
works o
. o

If o
the o
station o
strategy o
is o
set o
up o
that o
way o
, o
it o
's o
unlikely o
they o
will o
change o
. o

The o
only o
solution o
is o
through o
restructuring o
of o
the o
content o
, o
strengthening o
the o
rhythms o
, o
reducing o
the o
use o
of o
pointless o
patter o
to o
draw o
out o
the o
series o
, o
improving o
the o
dramatic o
structure o
, o
and o
adding o
new o
vitality o
to o
the o
roles o
. o
" o

But o
how o
? o

She o
takes o
for o
example o
feminist o
issues o
, o
about o
which o
she o
is o
particularly o
concerned o
. o

Twenty o
years o
ago o
, o
she o
wrote o
a o
TV o
serial o
that o
overturned o
the o
tradition o
that o
the o
female o
lead o
had o
to o
be o
chaste o
, o
unmarried o
, o
and o
dependent o
on o
men o
; o
instead o
her o
female o
lead o
was o
a o
middle o
- o
aged o
divorcee o
with o
children o
and o
a o
relationship o
with o
a o
younger o
man o
. o

Society o
was o
shocked o
from o
top o
to o
bottom o
. o

Today o
, o
as o
she o
produces o
Fortune o
, o
she o
still o
devotes o
special o
attention o
to o
the o
molding o
of o
the o
women o
's o
roles o
. o

From o
the o
character o
of o
the o
grandmother o
to o
that o
of o
the o
daughter o
, o
she o
insists o
that o
the o
script o
give o
them o
independent o
and o
strong o
- o
willed o
vitality o
. o

She o
says o
, o
" o
Although o
you o
can o
say o
that o
prime o
time o
serials o
are o
merchandise o
and o
not o
art o
, o
you o
have o
to o
present o
up o
- o
to o
- o
date o
positive o
values o
. o

You o
have o
to o
be o
responsible o
to o
the o
audience o
, o
and o
that o
's o
also o
the o
key o
to o
continual o
innovation o
. o
" o

Developing o
overseas o
markets o

Taiwanese o
television o
serials o
have o
always o
sold o
well o
abroad o
. o

But o
some o
people o
are o
concerned o
that o
an o
overemphasis o
on o
Taiwanese o
themes o
and o
language o
will o
stifle o
the o
development o
of o
overseas o
sales o
. o

" o
By o
nature o
, o
television o
drama o
is o
very o
localized o
. o

Because o
of o
cultural o
differences o
, o
overseas o
audiences o
will o
not o
necessarily o
like o
the o
same o
things o
Taiwan B-GPE
audiences o
do o
, o
" o

That o
is o
why o
many o
" o

chip o
" o
producers o
who o
control o
overseas o
copyrights o
are o
unwilling o
to o
touch o

They o
prefer o
to o

martial o

" o
dramas o
which o
are o
mainly o
just o
made o
- o
up o
stories o
in o
period o
costume o
-RRB- o
, o
but o
they o
are o
too o
slow o

moving o

Japanese o
TV o
relies o
mostly o
on o
packaging o
of o
well o
- o
known o
" o
idols o
, o
" o
with o
most o
of o
the o
effort o
going o
into o
the o
aesthetics o
of o
presentation o
, o
and o
little o
emphasis o
on o
storyline o
. o

Taiwan o
television o
drama o
, o
on o
the o
other o
hand o
, o
has o
conflict o
and o
intensity o
, o
and o
if o
it o
is o
well o
packaged o
, o
it o
should o
do o
well o
in o
the o
overseas o
market o
. o

" o
You o
ca o
n't o
say o
that o
there o
's o
no o
overseas o
market o
for o
drama o
just o
because o
it o
is o
nativist o
Taiwanese o
. o

After o
all o
, o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
drama o
series o
have o
dominated o
the o
Asian o
market o
for o
years o
, o
yet o
they o
also o
use o
a o
Chinese o
dialect o
- o
Cantonese o
- o
and o
are o
also o
set o
against o
the o
backdrop o
of o
their o
own o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
society o
. o

However o
, o
due o
to o
the o
strength o
of o
their o
entertainment o
industry o
, o
they o
've o
been o
able o
to o
penetrate o
everywhere o
, o
" o
says o
Tsai B-PER
Yen I-PER
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
can o
learn o
from o
this o
experience o
. o

Talent o
flow o

As o
interactions o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
the o
PRC B-ORG
have o
grown o
, o
over o
the o
past o
few o
years o
there o
have o
been o
many o
cases o
of o
cooperative o
filming o
involving o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
or o
of o
the o
hiring o
of o
technicians o
or o
performers o
from o
one o
area o
to o
work o
in o
another o
. o

For o
example o
, o
for o
the o
martial o
arts o
dramas o
of o
Yang B-PER
Pei I-PER
- I-PER
pei I-PER
, o
the o
scripts o
and o
actors o
come o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
the o
director o
and o
the o
costume o
designer o
are o
from o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
, o
and o
the o
series o
are o
filmed o
in o
the o
PRC B-ORG
using o
mainland o
technicians o
. o

Technically o
speaking o
, o
they o
are o
extremely o
well o
done o
. o

The o
same o
goes o
for o
Chiung B-PER
Yao I-PER
's I-PER
romantic o
dramas o
. o

However o
, o
given o
the o
different o
cultural o
backgrounds o
of o
these o
people o
, o
there o
are o
limits o
to o
cooperation o
, o
and o
if o
you o
factor o
in o
political o
considerations o
, o
that o
makes o
the o
situation o
even o
more o
complex o
. o

" o
Cross-national o
cooperation o
is o
the o
fastest o
way o
to o
get o
an o
infusion o
of o
fresh o
blood o
, o
but o
it o
is o
not o
a o
long o
- o
term o
solution o
, o
" o
says o
Lien B-PER
Chang I-PER
- I-PER
yu I-PER
. o

Recently o
the o
PRC B-ORG
has o
begun o
to o
limit o
the o
number o
of o
people o
who o
can o
work o
in o
cooperative o
projects o
in o
order o
to o
protect o
its o
own o
TV o
industry o
, o
and o
sudden o
changes o
such o
as o
this o
will o
inevitably o
have o
an o
impact o
. o

Prime o
time o
programming o
has o
long o
been o
a o
weaver o
of o
dreams o
for o
Taiwanese o
audiences o
. o

But o
there o
is o
a o
huge o
difference o
between o
today o
's o
society o
and o
that o
of o
30 o
years o
ago o
. o

If o
the o
dreams o
woven o
by o
the o
serials o
stay o
the o
same o
, o
or o
are o
even o
inferior o
, o
inevitably o
the o
audience o
will o
decline o
. o

Given o
the o
ever o
growing o
pluralization o
of o
society o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
these o
shows o
must o
find o
new o
talent o
, o
overcome o
formulaic o
stories o
, o
and o
halt o
the o
decline o
in o
audience o
share o
. o

Those o
in o
the o
industry o
must o
figure o
out o
how o
to o
draw o
people o
back o
. o

So o
- o
called o
" o
ON o
programming o
" o
- o
meaning o
that o
series o
episodes o
are o
shot o
right o
before o
the o
time o
of o
broadcast o
- o
is o
a o
special o
feature o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
prime o
- o
time o

serials o
. o

The o
advantage o
is o
that o
the o
story o
can o
be o
changed o
or o
the o
series o
extended o
or o
shortened o
depending o
upon o
ratings o
. o

The o
disadvantage o
is o
that o
quality o
may o
suffer o

The o

session o
of o
the o
Fourth o
Leg B-ORG
- I-ORG

ended o
on o
January o
15th o
. o

After o
government o
and o
opposition o
legislators o
burned o
the o
midnight o
oil o
for o
a o
whole o
week o
, o
113 o
bills o
were o
passed o
. o

Quantitatively o
, o
this o
was o
the o
most o
bills o
passed o
in o
a o
single o
session o
since o
1948 o
. o

But o
from o
the o
qualitative o
standpoint o
, o
there o
are o
many o
problems o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
the o
session o
saw o
a o
public o
scandal o
in o
which o
legislators o
have o
been o
suspected o
of o
using o
back o
- o
door o
channels o
to o
get o
state o
- o
run o
financial o
institutions o
to o
invest o
in o
private o
venture o
capital o
companies o
. o

Also o
, o
with o
the o
presidential o
elections o
fast o
approaching o
, o
many o
laws o
appeared o
intended o
to o
benefit o
a o
certain o
candidate o
. o

Controversial o
legislation o
included o
: o

1 o
. o

Regulations o
governing o
the o
distribution o
of o
expense o
account o
money o
to o
local o
elected o
representatives o
and o
village o
and o
neighborhood o
chiefs o
: o
These o
regulations o
greatly o
increase o
payments o
made o
to o
local o
executive o
and o
assembly o
officials o
. o

With o
the o
passage o
of o
this o
law o
, o
the o
budget o
for o
these o
expenses o
should o
be o
forced o
up o
from o
the o
current o
NT$ o
4.4 o
billion o
to o
more o
than o
NT$ o
7 o
billion o
. o

Besides o
being o
seen o
as o
a o
blatant o
handout o
to o
influence o
the o
presidential o
election o
, o
and o
a o
contradiction o
of o
government o
promises o
to o
eliminate o
the o
positions o
of o
these o
local o
officials o
-LRB- o
who o
are o
big o
players o
in o
political o
patronage o
networks o
-RRB- o
, o
the o
law o
also o
brought o
criticism o
from o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
city I-GPE
councillors o
, o
whose o
salaries o
are o
cut o
by o
the o
bill o
. o

However o
, o
Minister o

Interior o
Huang B-PER
Chu I-PER

wen I-PER
insists o
that o
city o
councillors o
were o
amply o
consulted o
during o
the o
drafting o
process o

The o
law o
to o
encourage o
private o
- o
sector o
participation o
in o
public o
infrastructure o
projects o
: o
This o
law o
stipulates o
that o
the o
private o
sector o
may o
undertake o
BOT o
projects o
-LRB- o
build o
, o
operate o
, o
and o
transfer o
to o
the o
government o
-RRB- o
for o
major o
public o
infrastructure o
, o
including o
development o
of o
new o
towns o
, o
major o
industrial o
enterprises o
, o
and o
high o
- o
tech o
facilities o
. o

Besides o
offering o
tax o
incentives o
, o
the o
new o
law o
will o
assist o
private o
investors o
to o
get o
beyond o
the o
limits o
of o
current o
law o
and o
invest o
in o
new o
land o
. o

Indeed o
, o
it o
will o
even o
enable o
private o
investors o
to o
undertake o
compulsory o
land o
purchasing o
using o
government o
authority o
. o

Also o
, o
companies o
involved o
in o
major o
transportation o
infrastructure o
will o
be o
allowed o
to o
issue o
new o
stock o
or o
corporate o
debt o
to o
raise o
funds o
. o

This o
law o
should o
have o
a o
positive o
effect o
for o
current o
BOT o
projects o
which o
are o
facing o
obstacles o
, o
including o
the o
high o
- o
speed o
railway o
and o
the o
proposed o
rapid o
transit o
line o
to o
CKS o
International o
Airport o
. o

There o
will o
now o
be o
a o
legal o
basis o
for o
the o
high o
- o
speed o
railway o
to o
raise o
more o
capital o
. o

Also o
, o
now o
that o
the o
regulations o
for o
establishing o
new o
towns o
have o
been o
revised o
, o
the o
proposed o

This o

This o
law o
has o
been o
criticized o
by o

as o
a o
serious o
distortion o
of o

as o
putting o
the o

into o
the o
position o
of o
being o
market o
players o

and o
as o
inevitably o
creating o

the o
manipulation o
of o

have o
argued o
that o

and o
this o

it o

to o

: o
This o
will o

as o
a o

, o
responsible o
for o
coastal o

and o
for o

Some o
say o
that o
this o
does o
not o
conform o
to o
the o
ideal o
of o

the o

and o
also o

that o
it o
is o
very o

to o

that o

A o

When o
Taiwanese o
business o
people o
take o
up o
an o
expatriate o
lifestyle o
, o
the o
thing o
they o
worry o
about o
most o
is o

matters o
, o
especially o
the o
education o
of o

For o
Taiwanese o
expatriates o
in o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
incompatibility o
between o
the o
Taiwanese o
and o
mainland o
education o
systems o
is o
the o
main o
reason o
why o
most o
of o
them o
do o
not o
move o
their o

across o
with o
them o
. o

In o
the o
city o
of o
Dongguan B-GPE

located o
just o
over o
40 o
kilometers o
east o
of o
Guangzhou B-GPE

the o
ground o
has o
already o

on o
a o
project o
to o
build o
the o
first o
school o
for o
Taiwanese o
children o
in o

There o
is o
an o
especially o
large o
Taiwanese o
expatriate o
community o
in o
the o
Dongguan B-GPE
area o
, o
and o
there o
are o
high o
hopes o
that o
the o
new o
school o
, o
scheduled o
to o
begin o
officially o
enrolling o

in o
September o
, o
will o
go o
a o
long o
way o
toward o
solving o
the o
nettlesome o
problem o
of o

" o
Sometimes o
I o

to o

everything o

out o
to o
do o
in o

, o
" o
says o
H. B-PER
D. I-PER
Ye I-PER
, o
" o
then o
I o
take o
a o
look o
at o
my o

it o
seems o
as o
though o
I o
have o

really o
done o

Why o
would o
someone o

be o
so o
down o
about o

Says o
Ye B-PER
with o
a o
worried o

" o
Recently o
my o

from o

about o

trying o
to o

getting o
out o
of o

and o
we o
're o
afraid o

might o
get o
into o

They o
say o
it o
's o
tough o
to o
try o
and o
raise o
children o
as o
an o

and o
I o
can o
sure o
attest o
to o
that o

I o

For o

In o

of o
Norman B-PER

whose o

a o

years o
in o

before o
moving o
to o
Dongguan B-GPE
, o
" o
The o
first o
thing o
to o
do o
is o
ask o
the o
children o
their o
reason o
for o
saying o
such o
things o
. o

Ask o
what o
their o
teachers o
say o
, o
and o
what o
they o
themselves o
think o
. o

Then o
go o
on o
to o
give o
them o
your o

views o

" o

While o

consider o
Hsu B-PER

approach o
a o
very o
enlightened o
one o
, o
there o
is o
no o

that o

the o

of o

Comments o
one o
Taiwanese o
businessman o
, o
" o
You o
worry o
that o
your o
kid o
is o
going o
to o
become o
a o
communist o
. o
" o

Taiwanese o
people o
in o
the o
mainland o
invariably o
wish o
to o
maintain o
their o
ties o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
are o
particularly o
anxious o
to o
ensure o
that o
their o
children o
can o
integrate o
quickly o
into o
the o
school o
system o
back o
home o
once o
they o
return o
. o

With o
the o
number o
of o
Taiwanese o
in o
Dongguan B-GPE
increasing o
in o
recent o
years o
, o
it o
was o
just o
a o
matter o
of o
time o
before o
a o
Taiwanese o
school o
was o
established o
. o

Thanks o
to o
the o
vigorous o
advocacy o
of o
H. B-PER
D. I-PER
Ye I-PER
, o
the o
TBAD B-ORG
began o
working o
seriously o
in o
1994 o
to o
establish o
a o
school o
, o
but o
the o
difficulties o
were o
considerable o
. o

They o
had o
to o
find o
land o
, o
funds o
, o
teachers o
, o
and o
much o
more o
. o

With o
Taiwanese o
and o
mainland o
authorities o
at o
political o
loggerheads o
, o
the o
school o
's o
promoters o
had o
to o
jump o
through o
hoops o
every o
step o
of o
the o
way o
in o
seeking o
to o
hire o
teachers o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
use o
Taiwanese o
teaching o
materials o
, o
and o
appoint o
a o
Taiwanese o
person o
to o
the o
post o
of o
principal o
. o

They o
also o
had o
to o
obtain o
the o
cooperation o
of o
the o
authorities o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Since o
the o
people o
in o
Dongguan B-GPE
were o
paying o
taxes o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
planning o
to o
run o
the o
school o
according o
to o
the o
Taiwanese o
system o
, o
they o
asked o
whether o
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Education I-ORG
might o
not o
treat o
the o
school o
the o
same o
as o
any o
private o
school o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
subsidize o
it o
accordingly o
. o

Teacher o
seniority o
was o
also o
a o
major o
issue o
in o
the o
effort o
to o
get o
the o
school o
established o
; o
if o
teachers o
from o
public o
schools o
were o
to o
teach o
in o
Dongguan B-GPE
, o
would o
they o
retain o
the o
seniority o
that o
they o
had o
built o
up o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
? o

" o
If o
we o
had o
n't o
been o
able o
to o
hire o
experienced o
teachers o
, o
" o
notes o
Ye B-PER
, o
" o
it o
would o
have o
seriously o
impaired o
the o
quality o
of o
our o
faculty o
. o
" o

Ye B-PER
continually o
stressed o
to o
authorities o
in o
both o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
the o
mainland o
, o
" o
Politics o
is o
for o
the o

In o
the o

The o
main o
obstacles o
were o
finally o
overcome o
by o
the o
end o
of o
1999 o
. o

The o
mainland o
Chinese o
authorities o
have o
agreed o
to o
allow o
the o

of o

As o
for o
the o
appointment o
of o

, o
TBAD B-ORG

Yeh I-PER
states o
, o
" o
I o
think o
the o
mainland o
authorities o
will o
handle o
the o
situation o
flexibly o

They o
'll o
probably o
let o
us o
hire o
who o
we o
want o
as o

The o

to o
the o

at o
an o
extremely o
low o

of o
the o
TBAD B-ORG

Division I-ORG
, o
is o
among o
the o
latter o
group o
. o

After o
her o
elder o
son o
and o
daughter o
finished o
elementary o
school o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
she o
sent o
them o
to o
a o
boarding o
school o
in o
Britain B-GPE
. o

Her o
ten o
- o
year o
- o
old o
child o
is o
too o
young o
for o
that o
though o
, o
so o
she o
sends o
him o
to o
a o
school o
in o
Shenzhen B-GPE
for o
the o
children o
of o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
expats o
. o

The o
child o
only o
comes o
home o
once o
a o
week o
, o
and o
sending o
him o
to o
the o
school o
in o
Shenzhen B-GPE
costs o
several o
hundred o
thousand o
NT o
dollars o
per o
year o
. o

The o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
elementary o
school o
and o
the o
international o
school o
are o
both o
an o
hour o
or o
two o
away o
from o
Dongguan B-GPE
, o
and o
many o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
in o
Dongguan B-GPE
want o
to o
be o
able o
to o
see o
their o
children o
every o
day o
. o

This o
prompted o
a o
group o
of o
them o
to o
establish o
a o
private o
bilingual o
school o
called o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
in o
February o
1998 o
. o

The o
school o
admits o
children o
from o
kindergarten o
-LRB- o
age o
five o
-RRB- o
through o
grade o
five o
of o
elementary o
school o
. o

Some o
of o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
's I-ORG
200 o
students o
-LRB- o
such o
as o
Norman B-PER
Hsu I-PER
's I-PER
child o
-RRB- o
used o
to o
go o
to o
school o
in o
Shenzhen B-GPE
, o
while o
others o
have o
transferred o
in o
from o
the o
mainland o
Chinese o
public o
school o
system o
. o

Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
is o
very o
similar o
to o
the o
Taiwanese o
school o
being o
promoted o
by o
the o
TBAD B-ORG
. o

Most o
of o
its o
teaching o
materials o
are o
very o
similar o
to o
those o
used o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
elementary o
schools o
, o
and o
of o
the o
15 o
or o
so o
teachers o
there o
, o
three o
are o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

The o
big o
difference o
is o
that o
classes o
are o
taught o
in o
both o
Chinese o
and o
English o
because o
the o
Taiwanese o
parents o
are o
very o
interested o
in o
seeing o
that o
their o
children o
learn o
English o
well o
. o

According o
to o
Huang B-PER
Su I-PER
, o
executive o
director o
of o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
, o
" o
A o
lot o
of o
parents o
keep o
after o
me o
to o
make o
sure o
that o
the o
children o
's o
education o
is o
exactly o
like o
the o
regular o
system o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
but o
I o
have o
to o
remind o
them o
that o
once o
you o
've o
left o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
you o
're o
not o
regular o
any o
longer o
. o
" o

According o
to o
Huang B-PER
, o
making o
the o
school o
a o
mirror o
image o
of o
those o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
does o
not o
necessarily o
mean o
that o
you o
are o
running o
a o
good o
school o
. o

The o
key o
is o
to o
provide o
an o
education o
that o
meets o
the o
needs o
of o
the o
students o
. o

In o
addition o
to o
Taiwanese o
teaching o
materials o
, o
she o
has o
also o
incorporated o
some o
materials o
from o
the o
mainland o
and o
overseas o
into o
the o
curriculum o
. o

Huang B-PER
Su I-PER
, o
who o
hails o
from o
Beijing B-GPE
, o
majored o
in o
English o
at o
university o
and o
is o
keenly o
interested o
in o
education o
. o

She o
came o
to o
Dongguan B-GPE
after o
marrying o
a o
Taiwanese o
expat o
there o
, o
and o
it o
was o
the o
Taiwanese o
business o
community o
that o
asked o
her o
to o
run o
a o
school o
. o

Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
now o
has o
a o
very o
good o
reputation o
in o
the o
Taiwanese o
community o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
some o
Taiwanese o
send o
their o
children o
to o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
from o
as o
far o
away o
as o
Zhuhai B-GPE
-LRB- o
just o
opposite o
Macau B-GPE
on o
the o
other o
side o
of o
the o
Pearl B-LOC
River I-LOC
estuary o
-RRB- o
. o

Huang B-PER
has o
been o
deeply o
impressed o
by o
the o
deep o
concern o
that o
Taiwanese o
parents o
show o
for o
their o
children o
's o
education o
in o
the o
face o
of o
difficulties o
posed o
by o
living o
away o
from o
their o
native o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

One o
parent o
, o
for o
example o
, o
practically o
begged o
her o
to o
admit o
his o
six o
- o
year o
old o
child o
, o
explaining o
, o
" o
He o
's o
never o
had o
any o
playmates o
. o

The o
only o
people o
he o
's o
ever o
been o
with o
are o
his o
nanny o
and o
some o
employees o
from o
the o
plant o
. o
" o

The o
Taiwanese o
kids o
at o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
come o
from o
many o
different o
backgrounds o
. o

Some o
speak o
in o
a o
mixture o
of o
Chinese o
and o
English o
, o
while o
others o
speak o
and o
look o
just o
like o
any o
mainland o
Chinese o
child o
. o

Many o
of o
them o
have o
transferred o
in o
and o
out o
of o
lots o
of o
different o
schools o
in o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
the o
mainland o
. o

There o
is o
no o
trace o
of o
the o
world o
's o
cares o
on o
their o
faces o
though o
; o
the o
thing o
they o
're o
most o
concerned o
about o
is o
studying o
a o
little o
less o
and o
playing o
a o
little o
more o
. o

One o
bespectacled o
child o
laments o
, o
" o
School o
is o
better o
in o
Canada B-GPE
because o
they o
do o
n't o
have o
to o
do o
so o
much o
homework o
. o

There o
's o
too o
much o
homework o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
the o
mainland o
. o

It o
's o
no o
fun o
. o
" o

An o
older o
brother o
and o
sister o
, o
it o
turns o
out o
, o
have o
both o
lived o
overseas o
. o

Huang B-PER
stays o
in o
close o
touch o
with o
the o
Taiwanese o
parents o
. o

Their o
children o
enjoy o
very o
comfortable o
homes o
and o
seem o
to o
have o
experienced o
much o
of o
the o
world o
, o
but o
the o
biggest o
problem o
is o
that o
" o
they o
are o
n't o
motivated o
and o
do o
n't o
understand o
why o
they o
should o
need o
to o
study o
. o
" o

Another o
problem o
for o
the o
school o
is o
the o
lack o
of o
interesting o
things o
to o
do o
in o
Dongguan B-GPE
. o

Unless o
teachers o
are o
very o
devoted o
to o
education o
, o
they o
are o
not o
likely o
to o
stay o
there o
long o
. o

" o
It o
's o
all o
the o
more o
difficult o
, o
" o
notes o
Huang B-PER
frankly o
, o
" o
to o
hold o
on o
to o
teachers o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
who o
ca o
n't o
help o
but o
compare o
their o
situation o
here o
with o
what o
they o
are o
accustomed o
to o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o
" o

The o
Taiwanese o
school o
will o
be o
faced o
with o
the o
same o
high o
turnover o
rate o
that o
has o
dogged o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
. o

Dongguan B-GPE
, o
cradle o
of o
scholars o

With o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
already o
in o
operation o
, o
why o
should o
the o
Taiwanese o
expats o
wish o
to o
establish o
a o
separate o
school o
for o
their o
children o
? o

Sylvia B-PER
Yang I-PER
points o
out o
that o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
is o
a o
private o
school o
with o
limited o
space o
and o
teaching o
staff o
, o
and o
even o
without o
the o
boarding o
expenses o
charged o
in o
Shenzhen B-GPE
, o
the o
tuition o
at o
Little B-ORG
Oxford I-ORG
still o
costs o
RMB o
38,000 o
-LRB- o
NT$ o
TYPE="MONEY" o
S_OFF="2">160,000 o
-RRB- o
per o
semester o
, o
more o
than o
many o
Taiwanese o
parents o
can o
pay o
. o

Says o
H. B-PER
D. I-PER
Ye I-PER
, o
" o
We o
would o
like o
to o
get o
funding o
from o
both o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
mainland o
authorities o
to o
hold o
tuition o
down o
. o
" o

Although o
the o
cornerstone o
has o
already o
been o
laid o
, o
Ye B-PER
reports o
that o
not o
enough o
funds o
have o
been o
raised o
, o
nor o
have o
all o
the o
teachers o
been o
hired o
. o

Although o
the o
picture o
generally o
looks o
pretty o
good o
, o
there o
is o
still o
much o
work o
to o
be o
done o
. o

Expenses o
for o
the o
first o
few o
years o
are o
expected o
to o
reach o
NT$ o
60 o
million o
, o
and o
only o
about o
NT$ o
20 o
million o
has o
been o
raised o
so o
far o
. o

Ye B-PER
often o
speaks o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
on o
the o
topic o
of o
investing o
in o
the o
mainland o
, o
something o
which o
he o
knows o
a o
lot o
about o
. o

Says o
Ye B-PER
jokingly o
, o
" o
I o
jack o
up o
my o
speaking o
fees o
to o
make o
extra o
money o
for o
the o
school o
. o
" o

The o
TBAD B-ORG
is o
now o
considering o
funding o
the o
school o
through o
an o
endowment o
, o
shares o
in o
which o
would o
be o
sold o
to o
business o
firms o
. o

The o
location o
for o
the o
school o
has o
already o
been o
selected o
. o

It o
is o
a o
large o
site o
in o
the o
township o
of o
Zhongtang B-GPE
. o

The o
lot o
is o
basically o
empty o
right o
now o
, o
but o
the o
roar o
of o
excavators o
fills o
the o
air o
, o
and o
the o
steel o
piles o
have o
already o
been o
driven o
. o

The o
school o
grounds o
are o
located o
next o
to o
the o
ancient o
Beidi o
Temple o
, o
which o
is o
shaded o
by o
the o
leaves o
of o
a o
spreading o
banyan o
tree o
. o

On o
the o
temple o
gate o
a o
fading o
couplet o
reads o
: o
" o
He o
who o
is o
truly o
dedicated o
to o
his o
endeavor o
will o
become o
a o
great o
master o
, o
and o
shall o
make o
of o
his o
surroundings o
a o
land o
of o
delight o
. o

He o
who o
has o
achieved o
true o
wisdom o
shall o
make o
of o
his o
home o
a o
cynosure o
for o
great o
talent o
, o
no o
matter o
where o
he o
may o
be o
. o
" o

The o
locals o
must o
have o
taken o
this o
message o
to o
heart o
over o
the o
years o
, o
because o
it o
is o
said o
that o
hometown o
scholars o
from o
Zhongtang B-GPE
often o
took o
the o
top o
spot o
in o
the o
imperial o
examinations o
of o
centuries o
past o
. o

It o
is o
very o
gratifying o
that o
a o
place o
like o
Dongguan B-GPE
, o
with o
its o
abundant o
business o
opportunities o
, o
should o
also o
have o
a o
scenic o
spot o
so o
rich o
in o
scholarly o
tradition o
. o

It o
is o
also o
exciting o
to o
look o
forward o
to o
the o
founding o
of o
a o
school o
for o
the o
Taiwanese o
business o
community o
. o

Apart o
from o
making o
money o
, o
will o
the o
expatriates o
here o
create o
a o
" o
Taiwanese o
miracle o
" o
on o
the o
cultural o
front o
as o
well o

pro-active o
construction o
of o
a o
missile o
defense o
system o
raise o
tensions o
between o
the o
two o
sides o
? o

How o
can o
Taiwan B-GPE
defend o
itself o
without o
provoking o
an o
irrational o
response o
from o
mainland o
China B-GPE
? o

Two o
national o
defense o
topics o
have o
been o
especially o
hot o
in o
this o
new o
year o
. o

One o
is o
that o
defense o
of o
the o
remote o
Pratas B-LOC
and o
Spratley B-LOC
Islands I-LOC
will o
be o
transferred o
to o
the B-ORG
Coast I-ORG
Guard I-ORG
Command I-ORG
. o

The o
second o
is o
the o
subject o
of o
missile o
defense o
. o

Both o
Kuomintang B-ORG

candidate o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
and o
Democratic B-ORG
Progressive I-ORG
Party I-ORG
presidential o
candidate o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
have o
commented o
on o
the o
subject o
. o

Last o
December o
, o
at o
a o
seminar o
at o
the B-ORG
Armed I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
University I-ORG
entitled o
" o
Transmillennial o
National o
Security o
and o
Military o
Strategy o
, o
" o
Lien B-PER
delivered o
an o
address o
entitled o
" o
National o
Defense o
Strategy o
and o
Construction o
in o
the o
New o
Century o
. o
" o

He o
suggested o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
will o
have o
to o
develop o
long o
- o
range o
missiles o
to o
counter o
the o
mainland o
Chinese o
military o
threat o
. o

While o
" o
effective o
deterrence o
" o
would o
remain o
the o
cornerstone o
of o
strategy o
, o
it o
should o
no o
longer o
be o
passive o
, o
said o
Lien B-PER
, o
but o
" o
pro-active o
. o
" o

The o
new o
generation o
of o
military o
capability o
will o
be o
based o
, o
he o
said o
, o
on o
the o
principle o
of o
" o
offensive o
defense o
. o
" o

The o
best o
defense o
is o
.... o

Chen B-PER
raised o
a o
similar o
idea o
. o

In o
his o
" o
Defense o
Policy o
White o
Paper o
, o
" o
he o
proposed o
developing o
medium o
- o
and o
short o
- o
range o
surface o
- o
to o
- o
surface o
missiles o
. o

Obviously o
, o
after o
the o
experience o
of o
the o
1996 o
Taiwan o
Strait o
missile o
crisis o
, o
people o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
considered o
defending o
the o
island o
against o
mainland o
Chinese o
missile o
attack o
to o
be o
one o
of o
the o
foremost o
defense o
problems o
. o

Interestingly o
, o
even o
as o
such o
" o
pro-active o
defense o
" o
ideas o
are o
being o
proposed o
, o
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
-LRB- o
MND B-ORG
-RRB- o
has o
made o
a o
seemingly o
contrary o
move o
: o
It o
has o
announced o
that o
military o
forces o
will o
be o
withdrawn o
from o
the o
remote o
offshore o
Pratas B-LOC
and o
Spratley B-LOC
islands I-LOC
, o
and o
that o
responsibility o
for o
these o
islands o
and o
for o
coastal o
patrolling o
will o
be o
transferred o
to o
the B-ORG
Coast I-ORG
Guard I-ORG
. o

The o
MND B-ORG
argues o
that o
since o
the o
military o
is o
being o
streamlined o
, o
in o
order o
to o
concentrate o
defense o
forces o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
Penghu B-GPE
, o
Kinmen B-GPE
, o
and o
Matsu B-GPE
, o
the o
defense o
of o
the o
Pratas B-LOC
and o
Spratley B-LOC
islands I-LOC
- o
which o
are o
in o
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
China I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
- o
and o
the o
protection o
of o
coastal o
fishing o
vessels o
and o
coastal o
security o
should o
be o
left o
to o
the B-ORG
Coast I-ORG
Guard I-ORG
. o

Withdrawing o
from o
the o
two o
islands o
groups o
while o
moving o
actively o
to o
build o
a o
missile o
system o
may o
look o
like o
contradictory o
moves o
, o
but o
in o
fact o
they o
're o
both o
part o
of o
the o
military o
blueprint o
for o
the o
future o
- o
the o
abandonment o
of o
initial o
use o
of o
military o
force o
, o
but o
the o
ability o
to o
retaliate o
when o
attacked o
. o

The o
military o
blueprint o
for o
the o
new o
century o
is o
still o
being o
drawn o
up o
. o

The o
stimulus o
for o
these o
new o
ideas o
has o
been o
the o
aggressive o
military o
deployments o
by o
mainland o
China B-GPE
aimed o
at o
Taiwan B-GPE

, o
says o
that o
the o
successful o
testing o
by o
mainland o
China B-GPE
of o
missiles o
in o
1996 o
has o
altered o
the o
lines o
of o
strategic o
thought o
on o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
strait o
. o

Guided o
missiles o
have o
replaced o
aircraft o
as o
the o
major o
threat o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

In o
recent o
years o
mainland o
China B-GPE
has o
also o
constructed o
short o
- o
range o
surface o
- o
to o
- o
surface o
missile o
bases o
along o
its o
Southeast B-LOC
Coast I-LOC
which o
are o
specifically o
targeted o
at o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

According o
to o
a o
report o
in o
the o
December o
22 o
, o
1999 o
Washington B-ORG

, o
in o
November o

that o
the o

begun o

a o

the o
Zhangzhou B-GPE

Lin B-PER
Cheng I-PER

yi I-PER
says o
that o
, o
besides o
rapidly o
building o
missile o
bases o
, o
the o
PRC B-GPE
has o
repeatedly o
stated o
that o
" o
there o
should o
be o
a o
timetable o
for o
resolution o
of o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
problem o
. o
" o

The o
PRC B-GPE
's o
extremely o
assertive o
deployment o
of o
armed o
capability o
opposite o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
deeply o
felt o
in o
the o
ROC B-GPE
. o

If o
Taiwan B-GPE
does o
not o
respond o
in o
time o
, o
it o
will o
be o
forced o
into o
an o
increasingly o
passive o
position o
. o

Lt. o
Gen. o
Fuh B-PER
Wei I-PER

and o
General B-ORG
Staff I-ORG
College I-ORG
at o
the B-ORG
Armed I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
University I-ORG
, o
notes o
that o
for o
the o
moment o
Taiwan B-GPE
still o
has o
a o
slight o
edge o
in o
terms o
of o
air o
defense o
. o

However o
, o
it o
is o
widely o
estimated o
that o
by o
2005 o
, o
there o
will o
be o
a o
shift o
in o
the o
military o
capabilities o
of o
the o
two o
sides o
. o

Although o
this o
prediction o
is o
not o
necessarily o
accurate o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
should o
work o
to o
maintain o
its o
edge o
so o
as o
to o
guarantee o
peace o
through o
strength o
. o

Fuh B-PER
Wei I-PER
- I-PER
ku I-PER
offers o
the o
following o
analysis o
: o
Currently o
the o
PRC B-GPE
weapons o
which o
pose o
the o
greatest o
threat o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
Sukhoi o
aircraft o
, o
M o
- o
class o
missiles o
, o
and o
cruise o
missiles o
. o

Of o
these o
, o
the o
aircraft o
are o
already o
strategically o
of o
the o
second o
rank o
, o
but o
Taiwan B-GPE
must o
be o
alert o
to o
the o
missiles o
. o

The o
M o
- o
class o
weapons o
can o
pass o
through o
the o
stratosphere o
directly o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
rear o
areas o
, o
while o
cruise o
missiles o
can o
undertake o
low o
- o
level o
long o
- o
range o
attacks o
. o

" o
We o
can o
defend o
against o
the o
M o
- o
class o
missiles o
with o
our o
Patriot o
missile o
defense o
system o
, o
but o
we o
currently o
have o
only o
limited o
ability o
to o
intercept o
cruise o
missiles o
. o

The o
most o
important o
subject o
for o
the o
moment o
is o
to o
rethink o
air o
defense o
strategy o
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

Missile o
difficulties o

Any o
discussion o
of o
missiles o
also o
involves o
many o
other o
issues o
, o
including o
international o
strategy o
and o
domestic o
civilian o
morale o
. o

From o
the o
point o
of o
view o
of o
international o
strategy o
, o
the o
US B-GPE
clearly o
does o
not o
want o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
develop o
its o
own o
offensive o
missile o
capability o
. o

The o
US B-GPE
responded o
negatively o
to o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
's I-PER
proposal o
to o
build o
long o
- o
range o
missiles o
. o

At o
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
's I-ORG
end o
- o
of o
- o
year o
press o
conference o
, o
US B-GPE
Under o
Secretary o
of o
State B-ORG
for o
Arms o
Control o
John B-PER
Holum I-PER
said o
that o
the o
US B-GPE
did o
not o
want o
to o
see o
Taiwan B-GPE
take o
any o
action o
which o
would o
violate o
the o
basic o
norms o
of o
the o
1987 o
Missile B-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Control I-ORG
Regime I-ORG
. o

Thus o
the o
US B-GPE
would o
not o
be o
happy o
to o
see o
Taiwan B-GPE
develop o
offensive o
long o
- o
range o
missile o
systems o
. o

Kuo B-PER
Cheng I-PER
- I-PER
liang I-PER
, o
a o
professor o
of o
political o
science o
at o
Soochow B-ORG
University I-ORG
, o
says o
that o
the o
US B-GPE
opposes o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
development o
of o
long o
- o
range o
missiles o
because o
of o
the o
US B-GPE
's o
long o
- o
range o
strategy o
vis o
- o
a o
- o
vis o
China B-GPE
. o

The o
US B-GPE
has o
always o
been o
responsible o
for o
strategic o
deterrence o
, o
while o
Taiwan B-GPE
handles o
local o
tactical o
defense o
. o

If o
Taiwan B-GPE
were o
to o
develop o
long o
- o
range o
missiles o
, o
this o
would o
change o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
defensive o
posture o
, o
and o
alter o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
- o
US B-GPE
military o
division o
of o
labor o
. o

There o
is o
another o
possibility o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
defending o
against o
the o
threat o
of o
missiles o
from o
the o
PRC B-GPE
. o

Besides o
building o
offensive o
systems o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
could o
also o
join o
the o
US B-GPE
Theater B-ORG
Missile I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
-LRB- o
TMD B-ORG
-RRB- o
plan o
. o

But o
this o
may o
not o
be o
feasible o
, o
says o
Bih B-PER
Chung I-PER
- I-PER
ho I-PER
, o
editor o
- o
in o
- o
chief o
of o
the o
defense o
magazine o
Defense B-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Monthly I-ORG
. o

He o
says o
that o
if o
Taiwan B-GPE
were o
to o
join o
the o
TMD B-ORG
this o
would o
be o
a o
return o
to o
a o
situation o
of o
joint o
US B-GPE
- o
Taiwan B-GPE
defense o
, o
such o
as o
existed o
during o
the o
Cold o
War o
, o
when o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
on o
the o
frontline o
in o
a o
chain o
of o
islands o
surrounding o
China B-GPE
. o

For o
the o
PRC B-GPE
, o
which o
is o
endeavoring o
to o
move o
from o
coastal o
defense o
to o
a o
blue o
- o
water o
capability o
, o
the o
provocation o
would o
be o
enormous o
. o

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has o
thus o
been o
deliberately o
unclear o
- o
it o
does o
not o
exclude o
Taiwan B-GPE
from o
the o
TMD B-ORG
, o
but o
it o
has o
not o
clearly o
said o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
would o
be o
included o
. o

In o
any o
case o
, o
says o
Lin B-PER
Chong I-PER
- I-PER
pin I-PER
, o
vice-chairman o
of o
the o
ROC B-GPE
's o
Mainland B-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Council I-ORG
, o
potential o
TMD B-ORG
buyers o
still o
do o
not o
know o
where o
the o
money o
would o
come o
from o
, o
while o
the o
TMD B-ORG
producer o
has o
not o
yet o
come o
up o
with o
a o
finished o
product o
. o

So o
this o
is o
still o
just o
a o
political o
debating o
point o
, o
and o
it o
is o
too o
early o
to o
talk o
about o
any o
impact o
on o
the o
military o
situation o
in o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. o

Domestic o
morale o

Thus o
, o
from o
the o
international o
strategic o
angle o
, o
it o
still o
seems o
most o
practical o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
have o
its o
own o
missile o
systems o
. o

Moreover o
, o
this o
is o
also o
necessary o
from o
the o
point o
of o
view o
of o
public o
opinion o
. o

In o
an o
analysis o
of o
the o
threat o
that o
guided o
missiles o
pose o
to o
morale o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
ROC B-GPE
Minister o
of o
Defense o
Tang B-PER
Fei I-PER
points o
out o
that o
perhaps o
for o
some o
countries o
a o
missile o
attack o
would o
have o
little o
impact o
. o

But o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
where o
resources o
are o
concentrated o
, o
missiles o
pose o
a o
serious o
threat o
to o
electrical o
power o
and o
petroleum o
production o
, o
to o
transportation o
-LRB- o
harbors o
, o
highways o
, o
airports o
, o
railroads o
-RRB- o
, o
and o
to o
factories o
. o

More o
importantly o
, o
he o
says o
, o
the o
citizens o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
not o
psychologically o
prepared o
. o

There o
has o
been o
no o
war o
for o
decades o
now o
, o
and o
there o
are o
even o
very o
few o
usable o
civil o
defense o
shelters o
. o

If o
the o
PRC B-GPE
were o
to o
launch o
200 o
- o
300 o
guided o
missiles o
against o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
although o
the o
damage o
to o
industry o
, o
power o
, o
and o
communications o
would o
probably o
not o
be o
as o
serious o
as o
was o
caused o
by o
the o
September o
21 o
earthquake o
, o
citizens o
are o
not o
psychologically o
prepared o
for o
war o
, o
and o
the o
economy o
might o
not o
be o
able o
to o
withstand o
the o
assault o
. o

Chung B-PER
Chien I-PER
, o
an o
expert o
on o
military o
affairs o
, o
says o
that o
the o
turbulence o
created o
in o
the o
public o
mind o
by o
the o
1996 o
PRC B-GPE
missile o
tests o
has o
not o
abated o
even o
today o
. o

The o
construction o
of o
an o
effective o
missile o
defense o
system o
is o
the o
main o
military o
problem o
in o
bringing o
peace o
of o
mind o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
citizens o
. o

Thus o
, o
in o
the o
presidential o
elections o
, o
although o
missile o
defense o
can o
not o
be o
said o
to o
be o
" o
the o
beef o
" o
of o
campaigning o
, o
it o
is o
still o
an o
important o
" o
side o
dish o
" o
that o
many o
citizens o
are o
concerned o
about o
. o

Beyond o
missiles o

If o
Taiwan B-GPE
can o
not o
develop o
long o
- o
range o
missiles o
or o
participate o
in o
the o
TMD B-ORG
plan o
, o
what o
effective o
strategic o
options o
are o
left o
? o

Fuh B-PER
Wei I-PER
- I-PER
ku I-PER
points o
out o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
domestically o
produced o
Sky o
Bow o
and o
Sky o
Sword o
missiles o
have o
defensive o
capability o
. o

But o
pure o
defense o
is o
not o
enough o
. o

Even o
if o
missile o
defense o
could o
be o
99 o
% o
effective o
, o
and o
only o
one o
percent o
of o
attacking o
missiles o
got o
through o
, o
the o
situation o
could o
still o
be o
a o
total o
loss o
. o

Thus o
, o
it o
would o
be o
more o
effective o
to o
build o
an o
offensive o
missile o
system o
to o
deter o
the o
enemy o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
's o
domestically o
produced o
Hsiung o
Feng o
missiles o
have o
over o
- o
the o
- o
horizon o
attack o
capability o
, o
and o
could o
remain o
the o
main o
focus o
of o
future o

Lin B-PER
points o
to o
other o
countries o
that o
have o
a o
doctrine o
of o
extending o
the o
battlefield o
outside o

. o

For o
example o
, o
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has o
developed o
its o
own o
SSMs o
, o
Singapore B-GPE
has o
airborne o
refueling o
capability o
, o
and o
Israel B-GPE
has o
a o
strategy o
of o
keeping o
the o
fighting o
outside o
its o
borders o
as o
much o
as o
possible o
. o

Of o
course o
, o
different o
countries o
are o
in o
different o
situations o
, o
and o
the o
external o
threats o
faced o
by o
these o
countries o
are o
not o
comparable o
to o
the o
cross-strait o

that o
although o
the o
idea o
of o
taking o
a o

is o
worth o

, o
it o
would o

, o
effective o

Alex B-PER

warns o
that o
currently o
both o

and o
the o

research o
focus o
on o
the o
possibility o
that o
the o
first o
wave o
of o
warfare o
in o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
will o
be o
a o
missile o
attack o
. o

This o
ignores o
the o
evolution o
of o
land o
- o
sea o
- o
air o
joint o
operations o
in o
modern o
warfare o
. o

Mainland o
China B-GPE
need o
not o
choose o
to o
use o
high o
- o
cost o
, o
limited o
- o
quantity o
guided o
missiles o
, o
but o
could o
instead o
use o
a o
large o
number o
of o
360 o
- o
km o
range o
rockets o
to o
first o
attack o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
air o
fields o
from o
the o
Chinese o
coast o
, o
thereby o
paralyzing o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
air o
superiority o
. o

Then o
, o
their o
navy o
could o
ferry o
raiders o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
less o
than o
one o
hour o
. o

Kao B-PER
recalls o
that o
Vietnamese o

were o
used o
to o
infiltrate o
US B-GPE
air o
fields o
in o
Vietnam B-GPE
and o
neutralize o
American o
air o

. o

Particularly o
now o
that o
the o
Coastal o
Defense o
Law o
has o
been o
passed o
, o
and o
responsibility o
for o
coastal o
patrols o
will o
pass o
to o

, o
if o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o

still o
operates o
under o
the o
traditional o
assumption o
of o
first o
establishing o
air o
and o
sea o
superiority o
followed o
by o

, o
this o
could o
give o

an o

to o

a o
death o
blow o
. o

" o
Although o
this o
is o
merely o
a o
hypothesis o
, o
it o
points o
to o
a o
blind o
spot o
: o
the o
first o
strike o
will o
not o
necessarily o
be o
missiles o
. o

A o
solid o
national o

requires o
that o
no o

" o

concludes o

Third o
wave o
warfare o

Even o
as o
discussion o
on o
missile o
systems o
continues o
, o
an o
unprecedented o
form o
of o
threat o
- o
third o
- o
wave o
warfare o
- o
is o
lurking o
. o

Lin B-PER
Chong I-PER

says o
that o
currently o
both o
sides o
are o
engaged o
in o
third o
- o
wave o
- o
warfare o
development o
. o

This o
type o
of o
warfare o
is o
divided o
into o
" o
hard o
kill o
" o
and o
" o
soft o
kill o
. o
" o

Hard o
kill o
refers o
to o
the o
deployment o
on o
missile o
warheads o
of o
weapons o
with o
directional o
capability o
- o
using o
, o
for o
example o
, o
lasers o
, o
microwaves o
, o
electromagnetic o
pulse o
, o
and o
particle o
beams o
- o
which o
could o
increase o
the o
destructiveness o
of o
missiles o
. o

" o
Soft o
kill o
" o
refers o
to o
computer o
viruses o
and o
electronic o
interference o
to o
destroy o
the o
enemy o
's o
computer o
systems o
, o
and o
thereby o
to o
neutralize o
the o
enemy o
's o
military o
capability o
in o
a o
bloodless o
manner o
. o

Some o
people o
see o
in o
third o
- o
wave o
warfare o
an o
opportunity o
to o
seize o
a o
decisive o
advantage o
in o
the o
face o
of o
a o
future o
armed o
threat o
from o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

To o
be o
sure o
, o
because o
of o
the o
domestic o
development o
of o
the o
electronics o
industry o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
the o
ROC B-GPE
has o
a o
certain o
advantage o
. o

The o
military o
is o
currently o
actively o
studying o
the o
construction o
of o
information o
war o
capability o
, o
and o
it o
hopes o
to o
cooperate o
with o
the o
private o
sector o
and o
utilize o
private o
- o
sector o
computer o
knowledge o
to o
jointly o
deploy o
an o
electronics o
defense o
network o
. o

This o
is o
a o
key o
area o
of o
development o
for o
the o
future o
in o
which o
Taiwan B-GPE
can o
rely o
on o
itself o
and o
need o
not o
be o
limited o
by o
what o
can o
be o
procured o
abroad o
. o

Construction o
of o
a o
complete o
defense o
system o
is o
essential o
, o
but o
the o
highest o
form o
of o
military o
strategy o
is o
still o
to o
defeat o
the o
enemy o
without o
firing o
a o
shot o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
the o
pro-active o
defense o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
currently o
studying o
is o
a o
way o
of o
pursuing o
peace o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
will o
not o
provoke o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
nor o
be o
the o
first o
to o
resort o
to o
war o
. o

But o
nor o
can o
it o
allow o
the o
PRC B-GPE
to o
think o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
so o
weak o
that o
the o
PRC B-GPE
will o
be o
tempted o
to o
act o
rashly o
. o

Pro-active o
defense o
is o
necessary o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
but o
the o
real o
goal o
of o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
side o
is o
peace o
. o

Perhaps o
militarily o
there o
's o
a o
standoff o
situation o
of o
mutual o
intimidation o
, o
but o
what o
Taiwan B-GPE
most o
hopes o
for o
is o
that o
the o
cross-strait o
problem o
can o
be o
peacefully o
resolved o
without o
deploying o
a o
single o
soldier o

In o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
" o
quiet o
revolution o
" o
of o
democratization o
, o
the o
people o
have o
participated o
enthusiastically o
, o
but o
not o
irrationally o
. o

Now o
that o
there o
are o
two o
strong o
parties o
, o
the o
KMT B-ORG
and o
DPP B-ORG
, o
the o
slogan o
of o
" o
peaceful o
rotation o
of o
political o
parties o
in o
power o
" o
has o
become o
one o
of o
the o
most o
widely o
used o
appeals o
for o
the o
opposition o
. o

It o
happens o
to o
be o
the o
turn o
of o
the o
mil o
- o
lennium o
, o
and o
this o
has o
inspired o
many o
people o
to o
think o
of o
change o
. o

In o
the o
middle o
of o
March o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
will o
select o
the o
president o
who o
will o
lead o
the o
island o
into o
the o
new o
century o
. o

But o
the o
election o
, o
besides o
affecting o
the o
future o
direction o
of o
the o
country o
, o
has o
another o
rarely o
mentioned o
dimension o
: o
Since o
the o
three o
major o
candidates o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
, o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
, o
and o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
are o
running o
roughly o
equal o
, o
this o
suggests o
that o
after o
the o
election o
there o
may o
be o
a o
restructuring o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
political o
party o
system o
. o

The o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
selecting o
not o
only o
their o
future o
leaders o
, o
but o
are o
choosing o
a o
new o
direction o
for o
party o
politics o
and o
democratic o
development o
. o

What o
is o
it o
about o
the o
political o
environment o
that o
means o
that o
the o
election o
for o
the o
president o
of o
the o
ROC B-GPE
, o
which o
was o
not o
conceived o
as o
a o
presidential o
system o
, o
will o
affect o
the o
future o
development o
of o
the o
country o
? o

How o
will o
party o
politics o
change o
after o
the o
election o
? o

Is o
there o
likely o
to o
be o
a o
constitutional o
crisis o
? o

In o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
the o
year o
2000 o
, o
there o
are o
many o
challenges o
: o

The o
pressure o
is o
on o
to o
achieve o
industrial o
upgrading o
and o
internationalization o
. o

Also o
, o
there o
needs o
to o
be o
clear o
progress o
in o
the o
critical o
area o
of o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o

Although o
entry o

the B-ORG
World I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
will o
create o
a o
new o
situation o
in o
the B-LOC

, o
the o
two o
sides o
remain o
in o
an o
obscure o
relationship o
that o
is o
neither o
war o
nor o
peace o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
must o
come o
up o
with o
a o
comprehensive o
policy o
that o
considers o
economic o
, o
diplomatic o
, o
and o
military o
factors o
. o

Internally o
, o
there o
are o
a o
number o
of o
worrying o
problems o
- o
" o

points o
out o
that o
, o
after o
a o
long o
era o
of o
rule o
by o
virtually o
unchallenged o
leaders o
, o
the o
electorate o
is o
looking o
for o
more o
choice o
. o

The o
2000 o
race o
, o
with o
so o
many o
tickets o
contending o
, o
reflects o
this o
aspiration o
. o

At o
the o
top o
, o
this o
election o
is o
a o
contest o
among o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
second o
- o
generation o
political o
elites o
. o

Underneath o
, o
it o
is o
a o
struggle o
among o
the o
various o
forces o
that o
currently o
exist o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
society o
. o

The o
KMT B-ORG
nominee o
, o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
, o
is o
seen o
as o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's I-PER
annointed o
successor o
. o

He o
represents o
the o
continuation o
of o
Kuomintang B-ORG
tradition o

Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
, o
the o
nominee o
of o
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Progressive I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, o
is o
the o
greatest o
hope o
for o
the o
opposition o
party o
as o
it o
seeks o
the o
first o
- o
ever o
transfer o
of o
power o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE

Independent o

James B-PER
Soong I-PER
, o
meanwhile o
, o
represents o
forces o
which o
have o
split o
away o
from o
the o
Kuomintang B-ORG
. o

He o
is o
seen o
as o
leading o
a o
second o
wave o
of o
" B-PER
anti-Lee I-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
" I-PER
sentiment o
, o
similar o
to o
that o
which o
led o
to o
the o
creation o
of o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
several o
years o
ago o
. o

Soong B-PER
's o
candidacy o
has o
opened o
up o
new o
fault o
lines o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
party o
politics o
, o
and o
has o
attracted o
the o
support o
of o
many o
NP B-ORG
legislators o
and o
other o
non-KMT B-ORG
and o
non-DPP B-ORG
forces o
. o

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
itself o
, o
which o
is o
on o
the o
edge o
of o
collapse o
, o
has o
nominated o
the o
renowned o
author o
Li B-PER
Ao I-PER
as o
its o
candidate o
, o
though o
Li B-PER
is o
not o
a o
party o
member o
. o

In o
addition o
to o
these o
four o
, o
former o
DPP B-ORG
chairman o
Hsu B-PER
Hsin I-PER
- I-PER
liang I-PER
, o
having o
failed o
to o
win o
the o
nomination o
of o
his o
party o
, o
withdrew o
from o
the o
DPP B-ORG
and o
is o
running o
as o
an o
independent o
. o

Since o
the o
campaign o
began o
in o
earnest o
, o
Lien B-PER
, o
Chen B-PER
, o
and o
Soong B-PER
have o
been o
getting o
roughly o
similar o
numbers o
in o
public o
opinion o
polls o
, o
with o
about o
a o
quarter o
of o
the o
electorate o
undecided o
. o

With o
the o
election o
so o
close o
at o
hand o
, o
and o
the o
situation o
so o
uncertain o
, o
naturally o
the o
media o
and o
society o
have o
been o
focused o
on o
analyzing o
the o
election o
battle o
itself o
. o

Very o
few o
people o
have o
transcended o
this o
to o
ask o
what o
impact o
the o
three o
- o
way o
power o
struggle o
will o
have o
on o
the o
future o
political o
situation o
. o

Public o
opinion o
trial o
balloon o

The o
ROC B-GPE
constitution o
was o
not o
originally o
designed o
as o
a o
presidential o
system o
. o

The o
constitution o
divided o
power o
among o
five o
branches o
of o
government o
, o
with o
the o
premier o
as o
head o
of o
the o
executive o
branch o
, o
and o
the o
president o
separate o
from o
, o
but o
theoretically o
not o
controlling o
, o
these o
five o
. o

In o
the o
past o
, o
presidents o
Chiang B-PER
Kai I-PER
- I-PER
shek I-PER
and o
Chiang B-PER
Ching I-PER
- I-PER
kuo I-PER
were o
the o
de o
facto o
unchallenged o
rulers o
of o
the o
nation o
, o
but o
that o
was o
because o
of o
their o
roles o
as o
chairmen o
of o
the o
Kuomintang B-ORG
, o
which o
, o
under o
the o
old o
one o
- o
party o
system o
, o
outlawed o
any o
opposition o
. o

They o
were o
president o
because o
they o
were o
powerful o
, o
not o
powerful o
because o
they o
were o
president o
. o

But o
today o
times o
have o
changed o
, o
and o
so o
has o
the o
constitution o
. o

Most o
importantly o
, o
the o
constitutional o
power o
of o
the o
president o
has o
been o
greatly o
increased o

University I-ORG
, o
notes o
that o
the o
president o
had o
always o
enjoyed o
a o
number o
of o
special o
powers o
: o
appointing o
and o
dismissing o
of o
officials o
, o
dissolving o
of o
the o
parliament o
, o
issuing o
of o
emergency o
decrees o
in o

policies o
through o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
and o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
. o

But o
recent o
constitutional o
revisions o
also o
give o
the o
president o
the o
power o
to o
appoint o
the o
premier o
without o
requiring o
approval o
from o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
. o

This o
means o
that o
the o
president o
is o
now o
the o
guiding o
figure o
behind o
all o
executive o
branch o
policy o
. o

Of o
course o
President o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's o
exercise o
of o
such o
powers o
has o
not o
proved o
politically o
destabilizing o
because o
he o
has o
been o
concurrently o
chairman o
of o
the o
KMT B-ORG
, o
which o
enjoys o
a o
majority o
in o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
. o

However o
, o
if o
the o
opposition o
wins o
the o
presidency o
, o
it o
is o
uncertain o
whether o
the o
president o
and o
legislature o
will o
be o
able o
to o
work o
together o
harmoniously o
. o

If o
there o
are o
conflicts o
, o
this o
could o
spark o
a o
constitutional o
crisis o
. o

Another o
development o
that o
needs o
watching o
is o
that o
direct o
election o
of o
the o
president o
has o
weakened o
political o
parties o
. o

Alexander B-PER

states o
that o
voters o
no o
longer o
base o
their o
choice o
primarily o
on o
political o
party o
. o

This o
is o
what o
has o
enabled o
independent o
candidate o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
to o
remain o
a o
powerful o
force o
even o
after o
leaving o
the o
KMT B-ORG
. o

Whether o
he o
wins o
or o
not o
, o
his o
candidacy o
signals o
a o
drastic o
change o
in o

Candidate o
as o

Lu B-PER
continues o
: o
" o
Direct o
election o
of o
the o
president o
has o
' o
put o
the o
candidate o
on o
a o
pedestal o
, o
' o
turning o
the o
attention o
of o
the o
voters o
to o
the o
individual o

But o
in o
fact o
the o
most o
significant o
thing o
about o
this o
election o
is o
not o
which o
' o
hero o
' o
will o
lead o
the o
country o
. o

Rather o
, o
voters o
should o
pay o
even o
more o
attention o
to o
how o
each o
of o
the o
candidates o
could o
affect o
future o
party o
politics o
and o
the o

In o
fact o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE

as o
the o

a o

- o
all o
understand o
the o
implications o
of o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
's I-PER
powerful o
candidacy o
very o
clearly o
. o

They o
know o
that o
this o
election o
is o
not o
only o
a o
struggle o
for o
political o
office o
, o
but o
even o
more o
is o
a o
critical o
moment o
that o
may o
decide o
whether o
their o

, o

up o
, o
or o

. o

KMT B-ORG
party o
chairman o
Lee B-PER

- I-PER
hui I-PER
has o
repeatedly o
called o
on o
voters o
to o
cherish o
the o
system o
of o
party o
politics o
that o
has o
been o
constructed o
in o
the o
process o
of o
democratization o
; o
the o
KMT B-ORG
wants o
confirmation o
that o
people o
still o
see o
it o
as o
a o
coherent o
, o
positive o
political o
institution o
. o

The o
DPP B-ORG
sees o
this o
election o
as o
its o
chance o
to o
displace o
the o
KMT B-ORG
and o
set o
a o
precedent o
for o
the o
peaceful o
rotation o
of o
political o
parties o
in o
power o
, o
thereby o
consolidating o
its o
position o
as o
the o

alternative o
to o

to o

that o

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
is o
in o
the o
most o
embarrassing o
position o
, o
since o
its o
candidate o
-LRB- B-PER
Li I-PER
Ao I-PER
-RRB- I-PER
is o
not o
even o
a o
party o
member o
, o

has o
been o
unable o
to o
keep o
most o
of o
its o
members o
from o
shifting o
their o
support o
to o
Soong B-PER
instead o
; o
this o
election o
could o
therefore o
hasten o
the o
collapse o
of o
the o
NP B-ORG
. o

Peaceful o
transfer o
of o
power o

If o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
is o
elected o
, o
this o
would o
be o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
first o
case o
of o
a o
peaceful o
transfer o
of o
power o
from o
one o
party o
to o
another o
. o

DPP B-ORG
legislator o
Chang B-PER
Chun I-PER
- I-PER
hung I-PER
says o
that o
the o
process o
of o
democratization o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
during o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's I-PER
administration o
has o
been o
smooth o
and o
tranquil o
, o
but o
beneath o
the o
surface o
there o
lurks o
a o
major o
threat o
to o
democracy o
: o
the o
KMT B-ORG
's o
" o
black o
gold o
politics o
. o
" o

Explains o
Chang B-PER
: o
The o
DPP B-ORG
has o
never o
had o
the o
chance o
to o
be o
the o
ruling o
party o
, o
and o
therefore o
has o
never o
been o
in o
a o
position o
to o
fulfill o
its o
function o
of o
restraining o
the o
KMT B-ORG
. o

The o
result o
of o
this o
long o
- o
term o
trend o
is o
that o
the o
KMT B-ORG
is o
" o
overnourished o
" o
by o
feeding o
on o
the o
resources o
of o
the o
state o
and o
society o
while o
the o
opposition o
parties o
are o
" o
undernourished o
. o
" o

Chang B-PER
says o
if o
there o
were o
a o
transfer o
of o
power o
, o
the o
opposition o
would o
be o
able o
to o
understand o
more o
clearly o
the o
actual o
difficulties o
of o
governing o
and o
to o
see o
more o
clearly o
the o
dark o
corners o
that o
need o
to o
be o
cleaned o
out o
. o

Meanwhile o
, o
the o
ruling o
party o
, o
with o
its o
rich o
experience o
in o
governing o
, o
would o
be o
very o
qualified o
to o
play o
the o
role o
of o
overseeing o
the o
DPP B-ORG
, o
and o
a o
defeat o
for o
the o
KMT B-ORG
could o
also o
promote o
its o
internal o
reassessment o
and o
reform o
. o

Were o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
to o
win o
, o
though o
the o
DPP B-ORG
would o
take o
control o
of o
the o
executive o
branch o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
current o
two o
- o
major o
- o
plus o
- o
one o
- o
minor o
party o
structure o
would o
probably o
not o
change o
very o
much o
. o

Chen B-PER
Wen I-PER
- I-PER
cheng I-PER
says o
that o
a o
Chen B-PER
victory o
would o
have o
its o
greatest o
impact o
on o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
- o
and o
that o
the o
effect o
would o
be o
positive o
. o

After o
an o
impressive o
start o
, o
the o
NP B-ORG
has o
faded o
steadily o
over o
the o
past o
few o
elections o
, o
and o
suffered o
an o
especially o
sharp o
blow o
in o
the o
election o
for o
mayor o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
two o
years o
ago o
. o

NP B-ORG
votes o
drifted o
to o
Ma B-PER
Ying I-PER
- I-PER
jeou I-PER
, o
a o
member o
of o
the o
KMT B-ORG
-LRB- o
albeit o
not o
one o
of o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's I-PER
personal o
favorites o
-RRB- o
. o

The o
NP B-ORG
candidate o
received o
only o
an o
anemic o
percentage o
of o
the o
ballots o
, o
bringing o
the o
party o
to o
the o
edge o
of o
collapse o
. o

But o
if o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
becomes o
president o
, o
because o
the o
DPP B-ORG
is o
seen o
as o
the o
party o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
independence o
- o
the o
direct o
antithesis o
of o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
- o
this o
could o
inspire o
NP B-ORG
members o
to o
pull o
together o
, o
and o
at o
the o
same o
time o
give o
the o
party o
the o
status o
and o
ability o
to o
absorb o
the o
forces o
that o
are o
backing o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
. o

This o
would o
contribute o
to o
the o
building o
of o
a o
true o
three o
- o
party o
system o
. o

An o
opposition o
- o
controlled o
legislature o

If o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
is o
elected o
, o
his o
biggest o
challenge o
will o
come o
from o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, o
and o
the o
first o
problem o
will o
be o
naming o
a o
premier o
. o

Although o
the o
constitution o
stipulates o
that o
the o
president o
does o
not o
need o
the o
approval o
of o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
to o
name o
a o
premier o
, o
given o
the o
fact o
that o
the o
KMT B-ORG
has o
a o
majority o
there o
, o
Chen B-PER
faces o
the o
problem o
of o
finding o
a o
premier o
who o
will o
be o
able o
to o
work o
with o
KMT B-ORG
legislators o
. o

The o
Chen B-PER
camp o
is o
well o
aware o
of o
this o
problem o
. o

Therefore o
they o
have o
let o
it o
be o
known o
that o
Chen B-PER
would o
like o
to o
ask o
Lee B-PER
Yuan I-PER
- I-PER
tse I-PER
, o
the o
universally o
respected o
Nobel o
Prize o
winner o
who o
is o
currently o
president o
of o
the B-ORG
Academia I-ORG
Sinica I-ORG
, o
to o
be o
his o
premier o
. o

Chen B-PER
, o
who o
knows o
that o
within o
the o
DPP B-ORG
there o
is o
little o
high o
- o
level o
governing o
experience o
, o
has o
repeatedly o
raised o
the o
idea o
of o
a o
" o
coalition o
government o
. o
" o

However o
, o
it o
should o
be o
noted o
, o
there o
are o
after o
all o
great o
ideological o
differences o
between o
the o
DPP B-ORG
and o
the o
other o
parties o
. o

KMT B-ORG
legislator o
Li B-PER
Hsien I-PER
- I-PER
jen I-PER
points o
out o
that o
the o
DPP B-ORG
retains o
advocacy o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
independence o
in o
its o
party o
platform o
, o
and o
DPP B-ORG
vice-presidential o
candidate o
Annette B-PER
Lu I-PER
is o
well o
known o
for o
her o
support o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
independence o
. o

It o
is o
therefore o
hard o
to o
guarantee o
that o
the o
executive o
branch o
will o
not o
come o
into o
conflict o
with o
the o
legislature o
. o

In o
such o
a o
conflict o
, o
the o
premier o
would o
be o
caught o
in o
the o
crossfire o
. o

The o
legislature o
could o
pass o
a o
vote o
of o
no o
confidence o
and o
completely o
boycott o
the o
premier o
, o
or o
the o
premier o
could o
dissolve o
the o
parliament o
and o
appeal o
to o
a o
public o
referendum o
. o

Either o
case o
would o
spark o
a o
constitutional o
crisis o
. o

Alexander B-PER
Lu I-PER
agrees o
that o
a o
Chen B-PER
victory o
could o
lead o
to o
inter-branch o
conflict o
. o

But o
he o
does o
not o
see o
Taiwan B-GPE
independence o
as o
the o
main o
flashpoint o
. o

The o
critical o
issues o
will o
instead o
be o
those o
related o
to o
" o
black o
gold o
politics o
, o
" o
such o
as o
stock o
trading o
taxes o
, o
which o
directly o
affect o
the o
interests o
of o
certain o
legislators o
. o

Lu B-PER
explains o
: o
" o
Currently o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
is o
filled o
with o
representatives o
of o
capital o
. o

When o
it o
comes o
to o
laws o
that o
directly o
affect o
their o
personal o
privileges o
and o
interests o
, o
even o
the o
KMT B-ORG
is o
powerless o
to o
control o
them o
. o

Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
has o
repeatedly o
emphasized o
that o
he o
intends o
to o
wipe o
out o
black o
gold o
politics o
and o
will o
never o
compromise o
. o

Inevitably o
, o
then o
, o
there o
will o
be o
a o
clash o
with o
these o
legislators o

Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
's I-PER
burden o

If o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
is o
elected o
, o
the o
party o
- o
politics o
issues o
most o
deserving o
of o
attention o
will o
be o
whether o
this o
hastens o
the o
demise o
of o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and o
whether o
the o
KMT B-ORG
party o
organization o
and o
the o
government o
can o
move o
together o
in o
step o
. o

Lien B-PER
is o
seen o
as o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's I-PER
designated o
successor o
. o

But o
, o
given o
the o
term o
system o
for o
the o
chairmanship o
of o
the o
KMT B-ORG
, o
after o
the o
election o
there o
will o
be o
a o
period o
of o
time o
in o
which o
Lee B-PER
remains o
party o
chairman o
, o
while o
Lien B-PER
is o
president o
. o

In o
the o
past o
, o
state o
policy o
has o
always o
been o
decided o
by o
the o
party o
chairman o
. o

Observers o
are o
very o
curious o
about o
whether o
the o
KMT B-ORG
has o
in o
fact o
changed o
, o
or o
whether o
we o
will o
see o
a o
repeat o
of o
what o
happened o
back o
in o
the o
late o
1970s o
: o

At o
that o
time o
Yen B-PER
Chia I-PER
- I-PER
kan I-PER
was o
president o
, o
but o
national o
policy o
was o
in o
fact o
determined o
by o
Chiang B-PER
Ching I-PER
- I-PER
kuo I-PER
, o
whose o
authority o
derived o
from o
his o
post o
as o
party o
chairman o
and o
who o
took o
the o
position o
of o
premier o
from o
which o
to o
oversee o
day o
- o
to o
- o
day o
policy o
- o
making o
. o

As o
Li B-PER
Hsien I-PER
- I-PER
jen I-PER
analyzes o
the o
situation o
, o
if o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
is o
elected o
, o
there o
will o
indeed o
be o
a o
transition o
period o
in o
his o
relations o
with o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
. o

But o
this o
is o
not o
necessarily o
a o
bad o
thing o
for o
the o
KMT B-ORG
. o

Consider o
, o
says o
Li B-PER
, o
the o
fact o
that o
James B-ORG
Soong I-ORG
's I-ORG
candidacy o
has o
raised o
the o
specter o
of o
a o
party o
split o
. o

A o
victory o
for o
Lien B-PER
, o
with o
Lee B-PER
continuing o
as o
party o
chairman o
, o
would o
be o
helpful o
to o
the o
KMT B-ORG
in o
resolving o
internal o
party o
disputes o
, o
and o
in o
consolidating o
Lien B-PER
's o
party o
and o
government o
position o
. o

He o
says o
that o
it o
is o
unlikely o
that o
the o
Yen B-PER
- o
Chiang B-PER
situation o
would o
be o
repeated o
, o
since o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
will o
certainly o
not o
have o
an o
office o
like o
premier o
which o
would o
involve o
him o
in o
day o
- o
to o
- o
day o
policy o
- o
making o
. o

What o
would o
a o
Lien B-PER
victory o
mean o
for o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
? o

Remember o
that o
the o
NP B-ORG
was o
organized o
primarily o
out o
of o
opposition o
to o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
. o

If o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
can o
escape o
from o
Lee B-PER
's o
shadow o
, o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
would o
lose o
its o
original o
purpose o
, o
and o
members o
could o
possibly o
return o
to o
the o
KMT B-ORG
, o
restoring o
the o
two o
- o
party o
system o
that o
reigned o
before o
the o
NP B-ORG
was o
formed o
. o

Another o
significant o
possibility o
is o
that o
New B-ORG
Party I-ORG
members o
, o
who o
tend o
to o
support o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
, o
could o
organize o
a o
brand o
- o
new o
political o
party o
with o
remnant o
Soong B-PER
backers o
after o
the o
election o
. o

Shao B-PER
Tsung I-PER
- I-PER
hai I-PER
, o
a o
professor o
at o
National B-ORG
Chengchih I-ORG
University I-ORG
and o
a o
campaign o
staffer o
for o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
, o
states o
: o
Soong B-PER
has o
reiterated o
that o
he o
personally o
has o
no o
intention o
of o
organizing o
a o
new o
political o
party o
after o
the o
election o
. o

But o
the o
political o
forces o
that o
support o
him o
will o
necessarily o
have o
to o
organize o
themselves o
in o
some o
fashion o
. o

Moreover o
, o
after o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
leaves o
the o
scene o
, o
and o
the o
NP B-ORG
no o
longer o
has o
that o
fixation o
, o
the o
possibility o
of o
establishing o
a o
new o
party o
with o
Soong B-PER
's o
other o
supporters o
-LRB- o
who o
by o
no o
means o
necessarily o
dislike o
Lee B-PER
-RRB- o
increases o
. o

If o
this o
happens o
, o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
will o
no o
longer o
be o
in o
decline o
as o
it o
is o
now o
, o
but o
will o
re-emerge o
as o
a o
force o
to o
be o
reckoned o
with o
, o
and o
Taiwan B-GPE
will o
be o
looking o
at o
a o
true o
three o
- o
party o
system o
. o

If o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
is o
elected o
, o
the o
KMT B-ORG
will o
continue o
to o
hold o
both o
executive o
power o
and o
a o
legislative o
majority o
, o
and o
the o
premier o
will o
serve o
simply o
as o
the o
chief o
of o
staff o
to o
the o
president o
. o

However o
, o
based o
on o
current o
public o
opinion o
polls o
, o
it o
appears o
that o
whoever o
wins o
, o
Lien B-PER
included o
, o
will o
be o
only o
a o
" o
plurality o
president o
, o
" o
without o
a o
strong o
mandate o
to o
rule o
. o

To o
a o
certain o
degree o
, o
then o
, o
he o
will o
have o
to o
accommodate o
other o
political o
forces o
. o

Chang B-PER
Chun I-PER
- I-PER
hung I-PER
, o
who o
knows o
the o
legislative o
environment o
very o
well o
, o
explains o
: o
" o
Even o
now o
in o
order o
to o
pass o
important o
legislation o
there o
must o
be o
compromise o
and o
negotiations o
. o

It o
will o
be o
virtually o
impossible o
for o
the o
KMT B-ORG
to o
railroad o
through o
legislation o
under o
the o
leadership o
of o
a o
president o
who o
does o
n't o
enjoy o
majority o
public o
support o
. o
" o

The o
need o
for o
compromise o
could o
be o
further o
increased o
by o
the o
proposed o
law o
currently o
under o
discussion o
to o
put o
all o
party o
assets o
in o
blind o
trust o
. o

This o
would o
, o
at o
least o
on o
paper o
, o
reduce o
the o
financial o
leverage o
the o
KMT B-ORG
would o
have o
over o
its o
legislators o
, o
and o
KMT B-ORG
representatives o
could o
become o
even o
more o
difficult o
for o
the o
party o
to o
control o
. o

Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
may o
face o
the o
problem o
of o
being o
unable o
to o
enforce o
the o
decisions o
of o
the o
party o
center o
. o

If o
Soong B-PER
wins o
. o
. o
. o
. o

Many o
supporters o
of o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
are o
people o
dissatisfied o
with o
the o
current o
state o
of o
the o
main o
parties o
. o

It o
is o
generally o
believed o
that o
if o
Soong B-PER
wins o
the o
election o
, o
this o
could o
spark o
a o
dramatic o
reorganization o
of o
party o
politics o
. o

The o
main o
blow o
could o
fall o
on o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, o
which o
could o
find o
itself o
made o
irrelevant o
, o
with o
the o
KMT B-ORG
also o
strongly o
affected o
. o

If o
Soong B-PER
wins o
, o
it o
is o
considered o
virtually o
inevitable o
that o
his o
supporters o
will o
organize o
some o
sort o
of o
political o
organization o
. o

Shao B-PER
Tsung I-PER
- I-PER
hai I-PER
says o
frankly o
that o
, o
even o
if o
Soong B-PER
himself o
does o
not o
lead o
the o
way o
, o
his o
supporters o
- o
faced o
with o
the o
reality o
of o
party o
politics o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
- o
would o
have o
to o
organize o
in o
order o
to o
coordinate o
their o
operations o
. o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
according o
to o
public o
opinion o
surveys o
, o
an o
extremely o
high o
percentage o
of o
NP B-ORG
members o
support o
Soong B-PER
. o

If o
Soong B-PER
wins o
, o
it o
would o
be o
logical o
for o
these o
people o
to o
leave o
the o
NP B-ORG
and o
join o
forces o
with o
other o
Soong B-PER
backers o
, o
thereby o
gutting o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. o

NP B-ORG
secretary o
- o
general o
Lee B-PER
Ben I-PER
- I-PER
nan I-PER
states o
: o
" o
As o
early o
as o
last o
year o
, o
the o
leadership o
realized o
that o
our o
party o
could o
potentially o
disappear o
" o
if o
Soong B-PER
wins o
. o

But o
Soong B-PER
is o
the o
closest o
of o
the o
three o
main o
candidates o
to o
the o
NP B-ORG
ideals o
, o
thus o
putting o
the o
NP B-ORG
in o
a o
dilemma o
. o

The o
party o
nominated o
Li B-PER
Ao I-PER
to o
maintain o
the o
party o
profile o
, o
and o
the o
NP B-ORG
leadership o
still o
calls o
on o
party o
members o
to o
support o
Li B-ORG
, o
but o
also o
says o
it o
will o
understand o
if o
its o
members o
vote o
for o
another o
candidate o
. o

If o
Soong B-PER
wins o
, o
the o
KMT B-ORG
could o
also o
be o
thrown o
into o
crisis o
. o

In o
this o
election o
, o
several o
leading o
KMT B-ORG
figures o
have o
publicly o
come o
out o
in o
favor o
of o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
, o
and o
have o
been o
expelled o
from o
the o
KMT B-ORG
as o
a o
result o
. o

Though o
these o
could o
be o
explained o
away o
as o
individuals o
who o
were o
not o
able o
to o
satisfy o
their o
personal o
ambitions o
inside o
the o
party o
, o
there o
are o
also o
many o
still o
in o
the o
KMT B-ORG
who o
secretly o
are o
pro-Soong o
. o

If o
elected o
, o
Soong B-PER
will o
have o
a o
wealth o
of o
government o
resources o
with o
which o
to o
attract o
even o
more o
people o
to o
openly o
support o
him o
, o
and o
this o
could o
be o
the o
straw o
that o
breaks o
the o
KMT B-ORG
's o
back o
. o

Based o
on o
this o
logic o
, o
Lin B-PER
Wen I-PER
- I-PER
cheng I-PER
says o
that o
an o
era o
of o
three o
- o
party o
politics o
is o
on o
the o
way o
. o

Though o
it o
is o
impossible o
to o
say o
whether o
such o
a o
situation o
would o
be o
stable o
, o
for o
those o
who o
are o
dissatisfied o
with o
the o
current o
choices o
and o
who o
want o
a o
reshuffling o
of o
party o
politics o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
this o
is o
the o
opportunity o
to o
create o
a o
fresh o
climate o
. o

Chang B-PER
Chun I-PER
- I-PER
hung I-PER
suggests o
that o
, o
in o
addition o
to o
uncertainty o
in o
party o
politics o
, o
a o
Soong B-PER
victory o
could o
also o
bring o
instability o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
constitutional o
system o
. o

Except o
for o
some o
of o
his o
followers o
who o
were o
with o
him o
in o
the o
provincial o
government o
, o
Soong B-PER
's o
camp o
lacks o
any o
experience o
in o
inter-group o
political o
bargaining o
. o

With o
Soong B-PER
as o
president o
, o
political o
elites o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
would o
be o
, o
as o
Alexander B-PER
Lu I-PER
describes o
it o
, o
like o
a o
basketball o
team o
whose o
players o
have o
never o
played o
together o
before o
. o

Soong B-PER
's o
camp o
will o
first o
have o
to o
integrate o
their o
own o
internal o
views o
, o
and o
then o
, o
to o
win o
confidence o
and o
trust o
from o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, o
work o
with o
both o
the o
KMT B-ORG
and o
the o
DPP B-ORG
. o

Such o
a o
situation o
is o
unlikely o
to o
result o
in o
much o
policy o
innovation o
, o
and o
in o
fact o
even o
the o
initial o
step o
of o
selecting o
a o
premier o
could o
prove o
extremely o
difficult o
. o

Although o
the o
KMT B-ORG
, o
DPP B-ORG
, o
and o
NP B-ORG
all o
have o
legislators o
who o
might o
join o
the o
Soong B-PER
camp o
if o
Soong B-PER
wins o
, o
Soong B-PER
's o
team o
will o
still o
need o
support o
from o
the o
KMT B-ORG
and/or o
the o
DPP B-ORG
, o
support o
they o
can o
only o
get o
through o
negotiation o
. o

Past o
experience o
has o
shown o
that o
the o
KMT B-ORG
and o
DPP B-ORG
can o
work o
together o
to o
boycott o
Executive B-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
proposals o
; o
if o
they o
do o
this o
to o
a o
Soong B-PER
- o
led o
executive o
branch o
, o
this o
could o
lead o
to o
a o
crisis o
ending o
in o
either o
a o
vote o
of o
no o
confidence o
or o
dissolution o
of o
the o
parliament o
. o

The o
possibility o
of o
a o
constitutional o
crisis o
looks o
much o
greater o
under o
Soong B-PER
than o
under o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
or o
Lien B-PER
Chan I-PER
. o

The o
" o
he o
's o
one o
of o
us o
" o
effect o

Few o
voters o
can o
see o
the o
significance o
of o
this o
election o
for o
party o
politics o
. o

In o
this o
atmosphere o
of o
choosing o
among o
" o
individual o
heroes o
" o
rather o
than o
parties o
, o
voters o
are o
more o
concerned o
about o
the o
candidates o
' o
characters o
and o
deportment o
than o
they o
are o
about o
their o
policy o
views o
or o
party o
backgrounds o
. o

That o
is o
why o
Soong B-PER
, o
who o
early o
on o
was o
significantly o
ahead o
of o
his o
rivals o
in o
public o
opinion o
polls o
, o
saw o
a o
dramatic o
drop o
in o
support o
after o
the o
Chung B-ORG
Hsing I-ORG
Bills I-ORG
scandal o
broke o
. o

Meanwhile o
, o
newspapers o
and o
TV o
are o
filled o
with o
negative o
advertising o
in o
which o
candidates o
sling o
mud o
at o
one o
another o
. o

These o
ads o
are o
giving o
voters o
the o
impression o
that o
the o
nation o
's o
future o
leaders o
are o
all o
" o
bad o
apples o
. o
" o

This o
not o
only o
marks o
the o
deterioration o
of o
electoral o
culture o
, o
but o
is o
a o
serious o
blow o
to o
morale o
in o
the o
nation o
and o
society o
. o

The o
effects o
may o
prove o
to o
be o
far o
- o
reaching o
. o

Chang B-PER
Chun I-PER
- I-PER
hung I-PER
adds o
that o
negative o
election o
tactics o
, o
which o
after o
all o
may o
be o
seen o
in o
any o
democratic o
country o
, o
are o
not o
- o
bad o
as o
they o
are o
- o
the o
biggest o
threat o
. o

He o
says o
Taiwan B-GPE
voters o
should o
most o
be o
on o
the o
lookout o
for o
the o
" o
one o
of o
us o
" o
effect o
. o

Mobilization o
of o
votes o
based o
on o
ethnicity o
or o
provincial o
origin o
is o
the o
cheapest o
route o
to o
victory o
. o

This o
has o
long o
been o
a o
tactic o
used o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
elections o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
ethnic o
groups o
are o
pitted o
against o
one o
another o
politically o
. o

Lin B-PER
Wen I-PER

states o
that o
in o
terms o
of o
daily o
life o
, o
differences o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
ethnic o
groups o
have o
largely o
disappeared o
. o

But o
, o
because o
ethnic o
cleavages o
are o

contends o
: o
" o
It o
is o
inevitable o
that o
minority o
groups o
in o
any o
society o
feel o
insecure o
about o
their o
status o
. o

In o
the o
last o
election o
for o
the o
mayor o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
, o
it o
was o
obvious o
that o
virtually o
all o
mainlanders o
voted o
for o
Ma B-PER
Ying I-PER
- I-PER
jeou I-PER
. o

Because o
the o
majority o
Taiwanese o
do o
not o
feel o
threatened o
, o
they o
were o
less o
likely o
to o
vote o
based o
on o
provincial o
origin o
, o
giving o
Ma B-PER
enough o
cross-over o
votes o
to o
beat o
out o
Chen B-PER

In o
this o

, o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
[ o

of o

from o

who o
sympathize o
with o
his o
outsider o

and o
remember o
his o

Unfortunately o
, o
however o
" o
natural o
" o
it o
is o
that o
minority o

insecure o
, o
exploitation o
of o
these o

only o

a o
negative o
long o

on o

In o
the o
2000 o
election o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
will o
not o
only o
be o
choosing o
a o
new o
leader o
. o

It o
will o
also o
be o
choosing o
a o

and o
between o

How o
can o

make o
a o

choice o
among o
the o

How o
can o

are o

I o

I o

the o

If o
it o
did o
n't o
, o
why o
not o
just o
get o
into o
a o
non-degree o
program o
? o

The o
truth o
is o
that o
a o
degree o
in o
management o
does o
nothing o
to o
help o
me o
in o
my o
current o
job o
, o

it o
gives o

a o

Advanced o
training o
for o

has o
become o
a o
hot o
topic o
among o

is o
nothing o

has o
offered o

for o

for o
over o
a o

, o
the o
difference o

that o
, o
upon o
completion o
of o
the o
curriculum o
students o
only o
receive o
a o
certificate o
of o

. o

In o
comparison o
, o
a o
Master o

is o
far o
more o
appealing o

that o
a o

by o
the o

, o
the o
enthusiasm o
of o
these o
professionals o
for o
their o
studies o
is o
impressive o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
they o
must o
pay o
a o
hefty o
price o
to o
be o
able o
to o

in o
the o

First o
, o
working o

the o
day o
and o
attending o

at o

is o
often o
a o
war o
of o
energy o
and o
will o
. o

Next o
, o
they o
must o
shuffle o
their o
work o
schedules o
to o
accommodate o
their o
studies o
. o

Many o
of o
them o
have o
to o
reschedule o
business o

her o

her o
by o
not o

sometimes o

One o
of o

questions o
is o
: o
" o
If o

were o
a o
fairy o
who o
could o
spell o
out o
for o
you o
exactly o
what o
you o

Or o
what o
if o
you o
were o
fated o
to o
have o
everything o

your o
way o

if o

for o

, o

Tom B-PER
Lin I-PER
, o
associate o
professor o
of o
marketing o
at o
NTUST B-PER
, o
describes o
the o
main o
difference o
between o
teaching o
adult o
executives o
and o
regular o
students o
: o

" o
Executives o
are o
always o
asking o
questions o
. o

Even o
when o
they o
have o
an o
idea o
themselves o
, o
they o
'll o
still o
bring o
up o
issues o
they o
encountered o
in o
their o
jobs o
to o
see o
how o
you o
respond o
. o
" o

Often o
, o
says o
Lin B-PER
, o
such o
questions o
leave o
him o
stumped o
. o

Another o
issue o
for o
adult o
students o
always o
on o
the o
run o
is o
their o
unfamiliarity o
with o
the o
campus o
. o

In o
order o
to o
enhance o
their o
sense o
of o
identification o
with o
the o
school o
, o
NTUST B-ORG
designed o
an o
overseas o
business o
camp o
program o
. o

Last o
year o
, o
one o
professor o
made o
a o
big o
hit o
with o
over o
30 o
students o
, o
taking o
them o
to o
mainland o
China B-GPE
for o
over o
ten o
days o
to o
familiarize o
them o
with o
the o
investment o
environment o
there o
. o

This o
year o
, o
trips o
are o
planned o
to o
Japan B-GPE
and o
Silicon B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
in o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

Planting o
in o
fertile o
soil o

Judging o
from o
the o
manner o
in o
which o
universities o
are o
opening o
their o
doors o
for o
continuing o
education o
, o
non-degree o
programs o
, o
and o
professional o
training o
, o
higher o
education o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
appears o
to o
be o
undergoing o
a o
sort o
of o
makeover o
. o

With o
these o
changes o
, o
universities o
must o
not o
only o
take o
care o
of o
teaching o
and o
research o
, o
but o
must o
also o
make o
sure o
they o
play o
their o
third o
function o
properly o
- o
spreading o
knowledge o
and o
sharing o
it o
with o
the o
public o
. o

Still o
, o
detractors o
point o
out o
that o
university o
graduate o
programs o
for o
business o
executives o
appear o
to o
be o
elitist o
. o

One o
student o
attending o
a o
non-degree o
program o
at o
NTUST B-ORG
relates o
that o
there o
are o
not o
enough o
spots o
to o
go o
around o
in o
the o
executive o
degree o
programs o
. o

Hoping o
to o
make o
the o
switch o
from o
the o
non-degree o
program o
, o
he o
failed o
to o
pass o
the o
screening o
that o
is o
administered o
prior o
to o
the o
admissions o
test o
. o

" o
If o
you o
fail o
a o
test o
, o
you o
only o
have o
yourself o
to o
blame o
, o
but o
tripping o
up o
on o
the o
initial o
screening o
is o
just o
a o
matter o
of o
not o
having o
a o
high o
enough o
job o
title o
. o
" o

Each o
year o
when o
EMBA o
program o
acceptances o
are o
released o
, o
newspapers o
carry o
letters o
from o
readers o
relating o
how o
certain o
national o
university o
graduate o
schools o
compete o
to o
accept o
CEOs o
and o
presidents o
of o
listed o
corporations o
, o
or o
the o
children o
of o
rich o
business o
people o
. o

The o
NTUST B-ORG
student o
expresses o
cynicism o
toward o
the o
application o
and o
review o
process o
, o
suspecting o
that o
" o
they o
just o
pay o
attention o
to o
company o
name o
and o
job o
title o
. o
" o

Moreover o
, o
continuing o
education o
courses o
charge o
hefty o
tuition o
fees o
. o

For o
instance o
, o
NTU B-ORG
divides o
the o
school o
year o
into o
three o
semesters o
, o
at o
NT$ o
50,000 o
per o
semester o
, o
while o
other o
institutions o
charge o
between o
NT$ o
3700 o
and o
$ o
10,000 o
per o
credit o
, o
a o
full o
two o
to o
three o
times o
more o
than o
regular o
graduate o
student o
tuition o
. o

Such o
instances o
naturally o
lead o
to o
suspicion o
that o
graduate o
schools o
such o
as o
these o
are o
" o
out o
to o
make o
a o
killing o
" o
by o
catering o
only o
to o
an o
elite o
few o
. o

" o
From o
review o
, o
to o
written o
test o
, o
to o
oral o
exam o
, o
in o
order o
to o
ensure o
fairness o
, o
no o
professor o
is o
involved o
in o
more o
than o
one o
portion o
of o
the o
process o
, o
" o

Huang B-PER
Chung I-PER

hsing I-PER
, o
director o
of o
the o
EMBA o
program o
at o

. o

Still o
, o
Huang B-PER
admits o
that o
the o
bigger o
the o
company o
and o
higher o
the o
candidate o
's o
job o
title o
, o
the o
greater o
their o
chances o
of o
acceptance o
into o
the o
program o
. o

This o
can o
be o
partially o
attributed o
to o
the o
belief o
among o
professors o
that o
the o
commitment o
of o
their o
educational o
resources o
yields o
" o
more o
bang o
for o
the o
buck o

Wu B-PER
tells o
his o
professors o
that o
unless o
they o
perform o
well o
in o
class o
, o
the o
EMBA o
can o
not o
develop o
further o
, o
as o
universities o
are o
founded o
upon o
academic o
research o
. o

As o
for o

Wu B-PER

Hwa I-PER
relates o
that o
with o
an o
annual o
budget o
of o
NT$ o
2.1 o
billion o
, o
National B-ORG
Chengchi I-ORG
University I-ORG
spends o
about o
NT$ o
200,000 o
per o
student o
. o

Thus o
, o
when o
it o
comes o
down o
to o
calculating o
costs o
, o
NT$ o
10,000 o
per o
credit o
is o
actually o
quite o
cheap o
. o

Industry o
retooling o

The o
EMBA o
craze o
reflects o
the o
cold o
, o
intense o
competition o
of o
social o
Darwinism o
, o
but o
does o
it o
also o
signify o
that o
Taiwanese o
industry o
is o
beginning o
to o
devote o
greater o
attention o
to o
the o
training o
of o
top o
executives o
? o

Many o
scholars o
believe o
that o
with o
the o
EMBA o
phenomenon o
just o
getting o
off o
its o
feet o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
many o
corporate o
bosses o
are o
taking o
a o
" o
wait o
- o
and o
- o
see o
" o
attitude o
. o

This o
is o
reflected o
in o
the o
way o
students o
approach o
the o
programs o
, o
not o
informing o
their o
bosses o
that o
they o
have o
applied o
to o
a o
program o
until o
they o
have o
been o
accepted o
, o
and o
not o
occupying o
work o

if o

takes o
place o
in o
the o
evening o

This o
way o
, o
their o
boss o
's o
attitude o
has o
no o
particular o
bearing o
on o
what o
they o
do o
. o

Perhaps o
business o
education o
may o
not o
be o
widespread o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
at o
this o
time o
, o
yet o
a o
small o

" o

is o

than o

, o
as o

Huang B-PER
notes o
three o
advantages o
of o
the o
boss o
going o
to o
school o
. o

First o
, o
it o
's o
good o
for o
his o
company o
's o
image o
. o

As o
his o
company o
must o
frequently o
seek o
bank o
loans o
, o
Huang B-PER
asks o
rhetorically o
, o
" o
Could o
a o
studious o
boss o
be o
a o
bad o
guy o
? o
" o

This o
image o
has o
helped o
him o
secure o
loans o
with o
little o
difficulty o
every o
time o
. o

Second o
, o
it o
sets o
a o
good o
example o
for o
employees o
. o

Lastly o
, o
speaking o
the o
professional o
lingo o
fluently o
helps o
enhance o
his o
authority o
. o

Knowledge o
for o
the o
new o
century o

In o
the o
effort o
to o
cultivate o
management o
talent o
, o
many o
prominent o
multinational o
corporations o
have o
founded o
their o
own o
teaching o
institutions o
, o
Toyota B-ORG
University I-ORG
and o
Intel B-ORG
University I-ORG
being o
two o
good o
examples o
. o

In o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
the B-ORG

opened o
its o
doors o
in o
Lungtan B-GPE
-LRB- o
Taoyuan B-GPE
Country I-GPE
-RRB- o
last o
October o
after o
three o
years o
of o
planning o
. o

During o
the o
Aspire B-ORG
Academy I-ORG
opening o
ceremony o
, o
academy o
president o
Stan B-PER
Shih I-PER
, o
chairman o
of o
the B-ORG
Acer I-ORG
Group I-ORG
, o
remarked o
that o
he o
hopes o
to o
introduce o
management o
models o
from o
Europe B-LOC
and o
America B-GPE
and o
mesh o
them o
with o
the o
unique o
attributes o
of o
Taiwanese o
industry o
to o
enhance o
the o
globalization o
of o
Asian o
business o
. o

Shih B-PER
noted o
that o
through o
the o
sharing o
of o
experiences o
, o
emerging o
businesses o
might o
save o
themselves o
a o
lot o
of o
groping o
in o
the o
dark o
. o

Are o
people o
at o
the o
fin o

inspired o
to o
learn o
by o
the o
confluence o
of o
technology o
, o
humanities o
, o
and o
economic o
knowledge o
? o

At o
least o
the o
entrepreneurs o
, o
managers o
, o
and o
executives o
in o
campuses o
around o
Taiwan B-GPE
clearly o
recognize o
that o
learning o
is o
a o
necessity o
for o
survival o
and o
an o
engine o
of o
growth o

This o
well o

Modern o

not o

In o
his o
book o
The o
Art o
of o
Life o
, o
the o
humorist o
Lin B-PER
Yutang I-PER
noted o
how o
" o
commercial o
advertising o
has o
commodified o
virtually o
every o
inch o
of o
a o

Now o
when o
you o

at o

you o
see o

displaying o
their o
oiled o
- o
up o
muscles o
, o
shiny o
white o
teeth o
, o
smooth o
and o
clean o

shaven o
skin o

elegant o

The o
" o
new o
man o
" o
is o
making o
himself o
over o
from o
head o
to o
toe o
, o
and o
is o
not o
averse o
to o
showing o
a o
more o
feminine o
side o
in o
doing o
so o
. o

Men o
are o
invading o
territory o
previously o
held o
exclusively o

and o
are o
declaring o
: o
" o

that o

" o

The o
determination o
of o
men o
in o

to o

It o
is o
frequently o
argued o
that o
it o
is o
a o
male o

dominated o
society o
that o
creates o
the o
need o
for o

up o
as o

who o
should o
get o
the o
" o
credit o
" o
for o
this o

that o

" o

" o
some o

many o

that o
a o

Betty B-PER
Wu I-PER
, o
a o
famous o
author o
and o
television o
host o
, o
says o
that o
today o
seven o
out o
of o
ten o
modern o
guys o
who o
buy o
name o
- o
brand o
fashions o
and o
use o
cosmetics o
do o
so o
under o
the o
influence o
of o
their o
girlfriends o
. o

Wu B-PER
has o
found o
that o
" o
modern o
men o
can o
in o
fact o
easily o
accept o
change o
. o
" o

Indeed o
, o
as o
consumers o
men o
are o
often o
easier o
to o
deal o
with o
than o
women o
, o
as o
they o
are o
more o
decisive o
about o
purchasing o
. o

When o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
a o
primarily o
agricultural o
, o
then o
primarily o
industrial o
, o
society o
, o
most o
men o
lived o
off o
physical o
labor o
. o

Few o
bothered o
to o
worry o
about o
their o
external o
appearance o
. o

Even o
office o
workers o
dressed o
the o
same o
every o
day o
for o
years o
on o
end o
. o

Of o
course o
, o
rich o
kids o
had o
the o
ability o
to o
dress o
up o
, o
but o
they o
were o
generally o
seen o
as o
playboys o
or o
dandies o
. o

But o
women o
have o
had o
enough o
of o
that o
, o
and o
these o
days o
have o
the o
economic o
wherewithal o
to o
do o
something o
about o
it o
. o

In o
the o
past o
, o
women o
could o
only o
be o
recipients o
of o
gifts o
from o
men o
, o
but o
now o
they o
are o
able o
to o
buy o
gifts o
to o
give o
to o
their o
male o
partners o
. o

Women o
are o
very o
familiar o
with o
the o
cosmetics o
market o
, o
and o
are o
now o
influencing o
the o
consumer o
behavior o
of o
their o
husbands o
and o
boyfriends o
. o

With o
a o
little o
help o
from o
women o
, o

taken o
off o

" o
Virtually o

Macho o
macho o
man o

In o
the o
view o
of o
Betty B-PER
Wu I-PER
, o
the o
reason o
men o
are o
daring o
to o
enter o
the o
ranks o
of o
beauty o
lovers o
, o
and o
even o
accept o
softer o
and o
more o
feminine o
standards o
of o
beauty o
, o
is o
because o
expectations o
of o
men o
in o
society o
have o
changed o
. o

The o
women o
of o
Generation o
X o
, o
born o
after o
1965 o
, o
have o
economic o
independence o
, o
and o
no o
longer o
are o
looking o
to o
men o
to o
support o
them o
and o
their o
children o
. o

Thus o
they o
no o
longer o
are o
looking o
for o
someone o
who o
" o
walks o
and o
talks o
like o
a o
real o
man o
. o
" o

In o
the o
past o
, o
the o
definition o
of o
" o
a o
real o
man o
" o
was o
usually o
one o
who o
could o
support o
a o
wife o
and o
children o
, o
and o
who o
would o
play o
the o
active o
role o
in o
a o
relationship o
, o
with o
the o
woman o
being o
the o
passive o
partner o
. o

Since o
more o
and o
more o
women o
do o
not o
expect o
a o
man o
to o
support o
them o
, o
what o
they o
are o
looking o
for o
in o
a o
man o
has o
also o
changed o

without o
the o

about o
it o

on o
a o
recent o
radio o
program o
: o

" o
The o
key o
factor o
allowing o
men o
to o
have o
the o
courage o
to o
display o
their o
own o
bodies o
is o
that o
they o
see o
their o
bodies o
as o
their o
own o
. o

Their o
bodies o
no o
longer o
belong o
to o
a o
cultural o
tradition o
or o
to o
other o
people o
. o

As o
men o
love o
themselves o
more o
, o
they o
can o
transfer o
some o
of o
this o
self o
- o
love o
to o
their o
bodies o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
modern o
men o
have o
discovered o
that o
can o
they o
can o
make o
a o
statement o
about o
themselves o
through o
their o
clothes o
and o
their o
bodies o
. o
" o

Whether o
awakened o
to o
a o
new o
sense o
of o
their o
own o
bodies o
by o
popular o
culture o
, o
or o
driven o
to o
stay o
at o
the o
forefront o
of o
commercial o
fashion o
, o
contemporary o
men o
have o
certainly o
made o
a o
firm o
decision o
to o
make o
themselves o
more o
beautiful o
. o

Moreover o
, o
as o
the o
service o
industry o
has o
come o
to o
dominate o
the o
economy o
, o
a o
fresh o
and o
clean o
appearance o
- o
with o
absolutely o
none o
of o
that o
macho o
sweat o
thing o
allowed o
- o
has o
become o
considered o
simply o
good o
manners o
. o

Many o
of o
the o
young o
men o
one o
might o
consider o
" o
vain o
" o
say o
that o
they o
only o
bother o
to o
create o
an o
immaculate o
external o
appearance o
because o
they o
need o
to o
look o
sharp o
for o
their o
jobs o
. o

Yet o
, o
simply o
not o
smelling o
repulsive o
is o
hardly o
enough o
to o
satisfy o
these o
men o

that o
this o

at o

From o
the o
celebrity o
advertisements o
in o
subway o
stations o
and o
on o
the o
sides o
of o

, o
you o
can o

Androgynous o
zone o

Ideally o
, o
businesses o
and o
popular o
culture o
want o
to o
be o
able o
to o
sweep o
everyone o
up o
in o
a o
single o
net o
, o
and o
would o
prefer o
not o
to o
break o
their o
market o
up o
by o
gender o
. o

It o
happens o
that o
many o
modern o
guys o
who o
go o
in o
for o
dressing o
up o
are o
also o
showing o
a o
trend o
toward o
androgynous o
standards o
of o
beauty o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
says o
Betty B-PER

, o
it o
is o
not o
only o
now o
that o
androgynous o
standards o
of o

are o
starting o

take o

in o
Taiwan B-GPE

Although o
everyone o
has o
a o
different o
aesthetic o
sense o
, o
and o
there o
are o
many o
kinds o
of o
beauty o
, o
" o
you o
can o
still o
identify o
certain o
trends o
, o
" o
she o
says o
. o

" o
Some o
years o
the o
look o
is o
the o
tough o
, o
hard o

, o
and o

a o
softer o
, o
more o

" o

Look o
at o
some o
of o
the o

of o

in o

These o

, o
more o
and o
more o

, o
in o

the o

Justin B-PER
Lin I-PER
, o
in o
his o
analysis o
of o
the o
pretty o
- o
boy o
phenomenon o
, o
avers o
: o
In o
the o
1990s o
, o
the o
general o
trend o
of o
all o
cutting o
- o
edge o
design o
was o
" o
super-youth o
. o
" o

Many o
well o
- o
established o
products o
appealing o
to o
the o
upper o
middle o
- o
class o
found o
it o
impossible o
to o
resist o
the o
trend o
toward o
youth o
and o
had o
to o
change o
their o
own o
design o
and o
style o
. o

Looking o
around o
, o
you o
can o
see o
a o
transition o
in o
the o
most o
popular o
types o
of o
male o
models o
. o

The o
muscle o
man o
and o
the o
James B-PER
Dean I-PER
type o
are o
on o
the o
way o
out o
. o

More o
and o
more o
the o
models o
are o
of o
the o
soft o
, o
almost o
feminine o
schoolboy o
type o
, o
the o
boy o
next o
- o
door o
type o
, o
or o
boys o
who o
look o
childish o
and o
underdeveloped o
, o
as o
if o
they o
lack o
experience o
. o

You o
could o
say o
that o
people o
just o
got o
tired o
of o
looking o
at o
macho o
men o
and o
cool o
dudes o
. o

But o
as o
Wang B-PER
Hao I-PER
- I-PER
wei I-PER
sees o
it o
, o
the o
deeper o
cause o
of o
the o
current o
worship o
of o
ever o
- o
greater o
youthfulness o
in o
modern o
society o
can o
be o
traced o
to o
the o
dissolution o
of o
the o
traditional o
family o
structure o
. o

Elders o
, o
who o
held o
all o
the o
power o
in o
the o
past o
, o
have o
become o
targets o
of o
derision o
. o

Businesses o
have o
no o
choice o
but o
to o
go o
along o
with o
the o
trend o
. o

Wang B-PER
concludes o
: o
" o
In o
a o
society o
in o
which o
individualism o
is o
important o
, o
youth o
is o
the o
best o
security o
. o
" o

Besides o
adapting o
to o
rising o
individualism o
, o
ever o
- o
alert o
commercial o
culture o
is o
also o
taking o
advantage o
of o
feminism o
and o
homosexual o
self o
- o
awareness o
. o

Cross-gender o
thinking o
is o
influencing o
the o
way o
men o
make o
themselves o
appear o
. o

This o
is o
especially o
apparent o
in o
the o
entertainment o
community o
, o
which o
sets o
the o
pace o
for o
popular o
culture o
and o
is o
often o
the o
fastest o
to o
pick o
up o
on o
new o
trends o
. o

Many o
in o
that o
field o
are o
crossing o
traditional o
barriers o
between o
male o
and o
female o
. o

In o
the o
past o
only o
women o
had o
sequins o
, o
embroidery o
, o
or o
skin o
- o
revealing o
gaps o
as o
part o
of o
their o
clothing o
, o
but o
now o
these o
are o
being o
put o
in o
men o
's o
clothing o
as o
well o
. o

Recently o
, o
the o
top o
four o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
male o
singing o
stars o
were o
seen o
on o
stage o
competing o
for o
attention o
while o
wearing o
skirts o
. o

You o
can o
expect o
that o
it o
wo o
n't o
be o
long o
before o
you o
can o
admire o
some o
guy o
on o
the o
street o
wearing o
a o
skirt o
. o

The o
new o
generation o
of o
young o
women o
mostly o
have o
a o
positive o
attitude o
toward o
androgynous o
beauty o
. o

As o
Lucia B-PER
Lee I-PER
says o
, o
" o
raw o
masculinity o
or o
raw o
femininity o
is o
of o
course o
attractive o
, o
but o
the o
more o
diversified o
is o
the o
pursuit o
of o
beauty o
, o
the o
more o
interesting o
the o
world o
is o
. o

As o
far o
as o
I o
'm o
concerned o
, o
if o
a o
guy o
wants o
to o
wear o
a o
skirt o
or o
have o
long o
hair o
, o
as o
long o
as o
it o
looks o
good o
, o
anything o
goes o
. o
" o

The o
Non-no o
set o

Male o
beauty o
is o
tending o
toward o
youth o
and o
gender o
neutrality o
, o
and o
those o
pursuing o
beauty o
are o
mainly o
young o
. o

They o
are o
the o
ones o
who o
most o
dare o
to o
and o
who o
can o
afford o
to o
. o

Wang B-PER

notes o
that o
in o
this o

people o
are o
increasingly o
forced o
into o
situations o
in o
which o

matters o
- o
for o
example o

on o
the o
lecture o
podium o
, o
or o
in o
front o
of o
the o

or o
the o

a o
greater o
sense o
of o
self o
- o
confidence o
, o
and o
feel o
more o
and o
more o
uncomfortable o
with o
their o

So o
they o
strive o
more o
and o
more o
to o
recover o
lost o
confidence o
by o
enhancing o
their o
external o
appearance o
. o

" o
If o

check o
it o
out o
for o
yourself o
- o

you o
wo o
n't o
find o
any o
ugly o

working o
there o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
there o
is o
still o
a o
lot o
of o
discrimination o
in o
our o
society o
based o
on o
appearance o
. o

It o
is o
not o
only o
the o
young o
who o
want o
to o
look o
better o
, o
and o
it o
seems o
the o
attitudes o
of o
the o
kids o
are o
affecting o
their o
elders o
at o
home o
. o

Besides o
supporting o
their o

in o
their o
40s o
are o
also o
starting o
to o
worry o
about o
whether o
they o
are o
looking o
old o
, o
and o
whether o
their o
beer o

guts o
are o
starting o
to o
show o

So o
they o
too o
are o
joining o
the o
ranks o
of o
those o
seeking o
cosmetic o

In o
the o

, o
Western o

lived o
for o
sun o

, o

These o
days o
, o
they o
think o
about o
how o
the o
sun o

cancer o
, o
the o
sea o
is o
filled o
with o
oil o

, o
and o

be o
fatal o

Thus o
a o
beautiful o
body o
, o
appropriate o

and o
healthy o

have o
become o
the o
new o

are o
in o
the o
" o

" o

He o
points o
to o
the o
fact o
that o
even o

playing o
this o
game o

In o
this o

, o
these o

The o

is o
billing o
itself o
as o
" o
the o
first o
book o
of o
sartorial o
philosophy o
against o
which o
men o
can o
measure o
themselves o
. o
" o

The o
book o
declares o
that o
as o
Taiwan B-GPE
moves o
toward o
internationalization o
, o
men o
are o
constantly o
required o
to o
appear o
in o
public o
places o
or o
at o
social o
gatherings o
, o
so o
that o
dressing o
up o
is o
no o
longer o
a o
monopoly o
of o
women o
. o

Playboys o
, o
not o
chauvinists o

The o
rapidity o
with o
which o
ideas o
and o
fads o
spread o
in o
a o
wealthy o
information o
society o
means o
that o
a o
love o
of o
beauty o
is o
not o
limited o
to o
one o
gender o
, o
and o
body o
- o
sculpting o
does o
not o
distinguish o
between o
young o
and o
old o
. o

Last o
year o
, o
a o
survey o
by o
Tung B-ORG
's I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
discovered o
that o
the o
gender o
/ o
age o
cohort o
most o
concerned o
about o
comparisons o
between o
their o
bodies o
and o
others o
' o
is o
men o
aged o
60 o
and o
above o
. o

They o
ranked o
higher o
than o
women o
or o
any o
other o
age o
group o
of o
men o
on o
" o
willingness o
to o
pay o
money o
to o
preserve o
or o
enhance o
physique o
" o
and o
" o
attention o
devoted o
to o
changes o
in o
physique o
. o
" o

The o
Foundation B-ORG
's o
suggested o
explanation o
is o
that o
these o
men o
were o
focused o
on o
their o
careers o
when o
they o
were o
younger o
, o
and o
they o
are o
only o
turning o
their o
attention o
to o
their o
appearance o
as o
they o
get o
older o
. o

The o
new o
generation o
, o
on o
the o
other o
hand o
, o
strikes o
a o
balance o
between o
career o
and o
appearance o
. o

This o
is o
not o
necessarily o
a o
bad o
thing o
. o

In o
the o
eyes o
of o
feminists o
, o
the o
arrival o
of o
the o
era o
of o
male o
preening o
has o
added o
a o
number o
of o
interesting o
possibilities o
to o
the o
game o
of o
mutual o
admiration o
between o
the o
sexes o
. o

But o
besides o
lustful o
appreciation o
there o
is o
a o
deeper o
question o
: o

Do o
the o
" o
peacocks o
" o
who o
have o
been o
influenced o
in o
part o
by o
feminist o
consciousness o
" o
have o
any o
different o
ideas o
or o
make o
any o
adjustments o
with o
regard o
to o
their o
roles o
in o
relations o
between o
the o
sexes o
? o
" o

Not o
necessarily o
, o

, o
spent o
an o
entire o

in o

observing o
the o
election o
campaign o
and o
its o

, o
and o
on o

, o
OPEN B-ORG
organized o
a o
seminar o
titled o
" o
The o
New o
President o
and o
Cross-Strait o
Relations o
. o
" o

The o
seminar o
was o
held o
in o
cooperation o
with o
Taiwan B-ORG
News I-ORG
, o
one o
of o
the o
island o
's o
oldest o
English o

language o
newspapers o
-LRB- o
known o
until o
last o
year o
as o
the B-ORG

. o

The o
KMT B-ORG
ticket o
finished o
nearly o
14 o
percentage o
points o
behind o
independent o
candidate o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
and o
pulled o
in o
fully o
two o
million o
votes o
fewer o
than o
the o
DPP B-ORG
ticket o
, o
a o
margin o
of o
defeat o
which o
Jin B-PER
Zhong I-PER
described o
in o
his o
opening o
remarks o
as o
stunning o
. o

When o
Chinese o
Communist o
premier o
Zhu B-PER
Rongji I-PER
made o
belligerent o
remarks o
a o
few o
days o
before o
the o
election o
in o
an o
effort o
to o
scare o
voters o
away o
from o
the o
DPP B-ORG
ticket o
, o
the o
ruling o
party o
made o
a o
grievous o
mistake o
, o
opined o
Jin B-PER
, o
when o
it o
failed o
to o
come o
out o
strongly o
critical o
of o
Zhu B-PER
and o
attempted o
instead o
to o
capitalize o
on o
the o
incident o
by o
playing o
the o
" o
fear o
card o
. o
" o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
however o
, o
winning o
candidate o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
captured o
only o
39 o
% o
of o
the o
vote o
, o
which o
translates o
to o
a o
weak o
mandate o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
he o
must o
take o
a o
moderate o
line o
that o
stresses o
inter-party o
cooperation o
. o

He o
will o
have o
to o
include o
a o
wide o
range o
of o
people o
in o
his o
government o
, o
keep o
a o
low o
profile o
, o
guard o
against o
any o
temptation o
to o
grow o
imperious o
in o
power o
, o
and o
strive o
to o
be o
a o
president o
of o
all o
the o
people o
. o

As o
for o
mainland o
China B-GPE
's o
saber o
- o
rattling o
, o
Jin B-PER
argued o
that o
there o
is o
no o
need o
for o
undue o
concern o
. o

Stated o
Jin B-PER
, o
" o
The o
consequences o
would o
be o
too o
severe o
. o

It o
's o
not o
like o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
without o
any o
means o
of o
retaliation o
. o

Are o
the o
mainland o
authorities o
really o
prepared o
to o
see o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
and o
Shanghai B-GPE
go o
up o
in o
flames o
? o
" o

There o
are o
other o
perspectives o
on o
cross-strait o
relations o
, o
of o
course o
. o

The o
seminar o
participants o
basically o
fell o
into o
three o
camps o
on o
future o
prospects o
. o

Some o
were o
highly o
optimistic o
, o
others o
were o
guardedly o
optimistic o
, o
and o
a o
third o
group o
argued o
that o
the o
crystal o
ball o
has o
gone o
cloudy o
. o

Perhaps o
the o
most o
optimistic o
view o
was o
expressed o
by o
Ruan B-PER
Ming I-PER
, o
a o
visiting o
professor o
at o
Tamkang B-ORG
University I-ORG
's I-ORG
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
Studies I-ORG
who o
in o
the o
1980s o
was o
an o
assistant o
to o
former o
Chinese o
Communist o
Secretary o
General o
Hu B-PER
Yaobang I-PER
. o

Ruan B-PER
stated o
that o
Beijing B-GPE
's o
basic o
position o
on o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
not o
changed o
at o
all o
since o
the o
days o
of o
Deng B-PER
Xiaoping I-PER
. o

" o
There o
's o
nothing o
new o
in o
what o
they o
're o
saying o
. o
" o

The o
only o
thing o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
are o
saying o
, o
says o
Ruan B-PER
, o
is o
that o
they o
will o
attack o
" o
if o
Taiwan B-GPE
makes o
any o
sort o
of o
formal o
move o
toward o
independence o
, o
" o
and o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
no o
need o
to o
formalize o
anything o
because o
changing o
the o
country o
's o
name o
would o
be o
meaningless o
. o

" o
No o
matter o
what o
you o
call o
yourself o
, o
people o
are o
still o
going o
to o
call o
you o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

It o
's o
just o
like o
in o
England B-GPE
- o
the o
official o
name o
is o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
of I-GPE
Great I-GPE
Britain I-GPE
and I-GPE
Northern I-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
, o
but o
nobody o
calls o
it o
that o
. o

And o
there o
's o
no o
need o
to o
going o
around o
shouting o
, o
' o
We o
're o
a o
country o
! o
We o
're o
a o
country o
! o
' o

Who o
in o
the o
international o
community o
does o
that o
? o
" o

Pragmatism o
, o
please o

" o
Taiwan B-GPE
needs o
to o
be o
more o
pragmatic o
, o
" o
says o
Ruan B-PER
, o
" o
just o
like o
the o
mainland o
. o
" o

They o
made o
a o
lot o
of o
noise o
ahead o
of o
the o
election o
trying o
to o
sway o
votes o
, o
but o
once o
the o
election o
was o
over o
they o
backpedaled o
quickly o
with o
the o
simple o
statement o
, o
" o
We o
'll o
wait o
and o
see o
what o
they o
say o
and o
do o
. o
" o

The o
attitude o
with o
them o
, o
in o
Ruan B-PER
's o
view o
, o
is o
very o
pragmatic o
. o

Ruan B-PER
is o
optimistic o
about o
cross-strait o
relations o
under o
the o
new o
regime o
, o
and o
states o
, o
" o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
is o
best o
positioned o
to o
improve o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o
" o

He o
likens o
Chen B-PER
to o
the o
staunchly o
anti-communist o
Richard B-PER
Nixon I-PER
, o
who o
was o
able o
to o
normalize o
ties o
with o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
precisely o
because o
he o
was o
trusted o
by o
the o
American o
people o
. o

Similarly o
, o
when o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
negotiates o
with o
Beijing B-GPE
, o
no o
one o
will o
worry o
about o
him o
selling o
Taiwan B-GPE
down o
the o
river o
. o

The o
noted o
political o
commentator o
Chin B-PER
Heng I-PER
- I-PER
wei I-PER
, o
chief o
editor o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
Contemporary B-ORG
Monthly I-ORG
, o
agreed o
strongly o
with o
Ruan B-PER
's o
comments o
, o
and o
added o
, o
" o
In o
this o
election o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
were o
even o
more o
concerned o
about o
domestic o
issues o
than o
they o
were o
about o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o
" o

The o
most o
pressing o
issues o
facing o
the o
new o
president o
are o
education o
, o
the o
environment o
, o
" o
black o
gold o
" o
politics o
-LRB- o
murky o
connections o
between o
the o
worlds o
of o
politics o
, o
business o
, o
and o
organized o

-RRB- o
, o
and o
crime o
fighting o

When o
Nobel o
laureate o
Lee B-PER
Yuan I-PER
- I-PER
tseh I-PER
came o
out o
in o
support o
of o
Chen B-PER

bian I-PER
, o
implying o
that o
the o
DPP B-ORG
represented o
" o
the o
progressive o
forces o
in o
society o
, o
" o
Chen B-PER
's o
support o
jumped o
immediately o
upward o
. o

Virtually o
everyone o
at o
the o
seminar o
was o
in o
agreement o
that o
it o
is o
neither o
advisable o
nor o
necessary o
to o
seek o
a o
quick o
solution o
to o
the o
cross-strait o
issue o
, o
and o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
need o
only o
avoid o
stirring o
up o
Chinese o
nationalism o
. o

of o
the o
municipal o

in o

-RRB- o
emphasized o
the o
fluid o
nature o
of o
Beijing B-GPE
's o
policy o
on o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

He o
feels o
that o
the o
mainland o
authorities o
face o
many o
more o
pressing o
issues o
than o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
that o
the o
current o
tension o
basically o
stems o
from o
President o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
's o
pronouncement o
on o
state o
- o
to o

state o

Having o
been o
through o
the o
Tiananmen o
massacre o
, o
Wei B-PER
felt o
compelled o
to o
warn o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
" o
You o
absolutely o
must o
not o
think o
the o
way o
the o
students o
did o
in o
Beijing B-GPE
in o
'89 o
. o

You o
must o
not o
think o
that o
' o
the o
communists o
wo o
n't o
attack o
because o
the o
US B-GPE
wo o
n't o
let o
them o
, o
' o
and o
then o
go o
out o
of o
your o
way o
to o
provoke o
them o
to o
where o
they o
no o
longer o
have o
an o
out o
. o

Under o
the o
wrong o
circumstances o
, o
failure o
to o
display o
strong o
Chinese o
nationalism o
could o
spell o
political o
suicide o
for o
a o
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
leader o
, o
and o
he o
might o
well o
decide o
, o
' o
To o
hell o
with o
the o
US B-GPE
and o
economic o
development o
, o
I o
've o
got o
to o
attack o
if o
I o
'm o
to o

That o
would o
be o
an o
incredible o

Chiu B-PER

, o
chief o
editor o
of o
the B-ORG
Hong I-ORG
Kong I-ORG
Economic I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
, o
also o
advocated o
cautious o
optimism o
. o

In o
his o
view o
, o
there o
has o
been o
no o
fundamental o
change o
in o
the o
cross-strait o
relationship o
, o
but o
he o
listed o
a o
few o
variables o
that o
bear o
close o
watching o
. o

The o
first o
is o
the o
combination o
of o
nationalism o
and o
Jiang B-PER
Zemin I-PER
's I-PER
desire o
to o
serve o
another o
term o
as o
Secretary o
General o
of o
the B-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and o
make o
his o
mark o
on o
history o
. o

Could o
he o
attempt o
to o
use o
nationalism o
to o
further o
his o
ambition o
? o

Second o
, o
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
's I-ORG
Liberation I-ORG
Army I-ORG
hopes o
to o
parlay o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
issue o
into o
increased o
influence o
in o
domestic o
politics o
. o

Third o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
could o
make o
mistakes o
and o
give o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
an o
excuse o
for o
military o
action o
. o

And o
a o
fourth o
factor o
is o
the o
wishy o
- o
washy o
American o
support o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

If o
all o
of o
these o
variables o
combined o
in o
the o
wrong o
way o
, o
the o
military o
authorities o
could o
make o
a o
miscalculation o
that o
would o
lead o
to o
war o

the o

Chou B-PER
, o
as o
a o
former o
official o
with o
the B-ORG
Straits I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, o
has o
had o
direct o
dealings o
with o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
. o

He o
argued o
that o
the o
DPP B-ORG
's o
view o
of o
the o
mainland o
has o
always o
been o
colored o
by o
ideology o
, o
and o
thus o
take o
a o
dim o
view o
of o
the o
other o
side o
. o

It o
is o
true o
, o
acknowledges o
Chou B-PER
, o
that o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
has o
changed o
his o
basic o
stance o
and o
now o
says o
that o
he o
" o
will o
not o
change o
the o
country o
's o
name o
, o
declare o
independence o
, o
or o
seek o
to o
enshrine o
the o
state o
- o
to o
- o
state o
principle o
in o
the o
constitution o
. o
" o

It o
is o
also o
true o
that o
Lee B-PER
Yuan I-PER
- I-PER
tseh I-PER
-LRB- o
who o
is o
highly o
respected o
in o
the o
mainland o
for o
his o
academic o
achievements o
-RRB- o
has o
vouched o
for o
the o
sensibility o
of o
Chen B-PER
's o
approach o
to o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o

And o
yes o
, o
once o
again o
, o
it o
is o
true o
that o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
have o
muted o
their o
rhetoric o
considerably o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
the o
two o
sides o
view o
each o
other o
with o
suspicion o
. o

If o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
conclude o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
leadership o
has o
dropped o
its o
insistence o
on o
formal o
independence o
only o
to o
pursue o
a o
policy o
that o
includes o
de o
facto o
independence o
as o
its o
aim o
, o
Chou B-PER
argued o
that o
this o
will o
introduce o
a o
note o
of o
uncertainty o
into o
the o
relationship o
. o

Tseng B-PER
Fu I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
feels o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
should o
claim o
the o
high o
ground o
by o
holding o
up o
its o
experience o
in o
democratization o
as o
an o
example o
for o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
. o

Says o
Tseng o
, o
" o
Reunification o
depends o
entirely o
on o
whether o
China B-GPE
can o
democratize o
. o
" o

His o
biggest o
worry o
is o
that o
the o
deep o
gulf o
between o
the o
DPP B-ORG
and o
the o
mainland o
authorities o
could o
cause o
them o
to o
misread o
each o
other o
. o

He o
stressed o
that o
there o
are o
both o
doves o
and o
hawks o
on o
all o
sides o
of o
the o
trilateral o
relationship o
between o
Beijing B-GPE
, o
Washington B-GPE
, o
and o
Taipei B-GPE

If o
the o
hawks o
gained o
the o
upper o
hand o
at o
the o

time o
in o
all o
three o
capitals o
, o
opined o

the o
result o
could o
be o

The o

Versatile o

offered o
some o
very o
incisive o
comments o
regarding o
the o

In o

resign o
as o

, o
Ping B-PER
-LRB- o
herself o
a o
second o

" o
-RRB- o
argued o
that o
the o
protest o
revealed o
an o
ethnic o
fault o
line o
in o
Taiwanese o
society o
. o

It o
was o
a o
venting o
of o
mass o
frustration o
on o
the o
part o
of o
one o
particular o
ethnic o
group o
, o
said o
Ping B-PER
, o
noting o
that o
most o
of o
the o
protesters o
were o
mainlanders o
. o

This o
group o
feels o
a o
loss o
of o
status o
, o
for o
during o
the o
many o
decades o
of o
KMT B-ORG
rule o
they o
have o
always o
thought o
of o
themselves o
as o
a o
privileged o
" o

" o
in o

even o
though o
in o

they o
are o
a o
minority o

their o

they o
have o
an o
unconscious o
feeling o
of o
superiority o
vis o
- o
a o
- o
vis o
the o
local o
majority o
. o

In o
some o
ways o
the o
election o
has o
forced o
them o
to o
realize o
that o
they o
truly o
are o
a o
minority o
. o

This o
development o
should o
help o
to o
bring o
about o
long o
- o
lasting o
ethnic o
harmony o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

The o
participants o
generally o
felt o
that o
the o
election o
was o
a o
victory o
for o
democracy o
. o

On o
the o
domestic o
front o
, o
the o
victory o
of o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
showed o
that o
people o
want o
more o
democracy o
, o
greater o
respect o
for o
human o
rights o
, o
and o
a o
more o
serious o
effort o
to o
banish o
" o
black o
gold o
" o
from o
the o
political o
arena o
. o

In o
cross-strait o
relations o
Chen B-PER
's o
victory o
spells o
the o
end o
of o
an o
era o
in o
which o
the o
cross-strait o
relationship o
was o
conducted o
within o
the o
framework o
of o
a o
civil o
war o
between o

Reform o

the o
KMT B-ORG
and o
the o

of o

by o
James B-PER
Soong I-PER
will o
also o
improve o
the o
political o
system o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

It o
appears o
that o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
finally o
taken o
their o
first o
bold o
step o
into o
an o
era o
of o
true o

From o

's o
point o
of o
view o
, o

To o
be o
sure o
, o
since o
the o
establishment o
of o
diplomatic o
relations o
between o
the o
ROC B-GPE
and o
Palau B-GPE
last o
December o
29 o
, o
the o
island o
has o
received o
considerable o
media o
attention o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

The o
number o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
visitors o
to o
Palau B-GPE
in o
January o
was o
double o
the o
number o
of o
last o

In o
March o
, o
foreign o

Chen B-PER
Chien I-PER
- I-PER

led o
a o
delegation o
to o

included o
government o

, o
private o

people o
, o
and o
representatives o

This o
" o

fever o
" o
has o
also o
infected o
Taiwan B-GPE
business o
people o
, o
who o
are o
always o
" o
susceptible o
" o
to o
new o
opportunities o
. o

Building o
on o
the o
foundation o
of o
formal o
diplomatic o
relations o
, o
many o
Taiwanese o
firms o
are o
anxious o
to o
try o
their o
hand o
and o
to o
explore o
Palau B-GPE
's o
investment o

Though o
this o
may o
seem o
far o
, o
far o
away o
, o
in o
fact o
, o
Palau B-GPE
is o
geographically o
the o
closest o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
of o
all o
the o
countries o
with o
which o
the o

A o
direct o
flight o
takes o
only o
three o
- o
and o
- o
a o

half o

Perhaps o
for o
Taiwanese o
, o
there o
are o
rather o
more o
immediate o
implications o
to o
" o

much o
more o
in o
common o
in o
terms o
of o
culture o
and o
historical o
position o
than o
most o
people o

The o
people o
of o

of o
the o

as o
the o

both o
Taiwan B-GPE

the o

of o

Stone B-PER
states o
: o
" o
Before o
independence o
, o
there o
was o
a o
serious o
lack o
of o
tourist o
facilities o
in o
Palau B-GPE
. o

Most o
of o
the o
visitors o
were o
in o
specially o
- o
organized o
groups o
from o
the o
US B-GPE
or o
Japan B-GPE
which o
came o
for o
deep o
sea o
fishing o
or o
scuba o
diving o
. o

It o
was o
only o
when o
Taiwan B-GPE
tourist o
agencies o
began o
developing o
the o
tourist o
route o
to o
Palau B-GPE
that o
many o
Taiwanese o
began o
to o
invest o
in o
the o
tourism o

here o
. o
" o

Snorkeling o
, o
one o
of o
the o
most o
popular o
activities o
in o
Palau B-GPE
, o
was o
brought o
in o
by o
Taiwanese o
entrepreneurs o

and o
you o
could o
say o
that o
they o
have o
been o
among o
the o
founders o
of o
the o
Palauan o

. o

Currently o
there o
are o
more o
than o
100 o

Most o

, o
in o

such o
as o

Though o
most o
of o
the o

there o
are o
large o
projects o
, o

the o

, o
who o
visited o
the o
island o
in o
March o
, o
points o
to o
some o
special o
concerns o
in o
the o
Palau B-GPE
investment o
environment o
: o
For o
one o
thing o
, o
the o
main o
islands o
are o
too o
rocky o
for o
agricultural o
development o
. o

Moreover o
, o
the o
economy o
is o
not o
highly o
developed o
, o
and o
- o
except o
for o
fishing o
products o
- o
other o
materials o
all o
have o
to o
be o
imported o
. o

Therefore o
the o
island o
is o
not o
at o
an o
advantage o
in o
material o
terms o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
the o
total o
population o
is o
only o
18,000 o
. o

Anyone o
interested o
in o
establishing o
a o
factory o
there o
will o
face o
a o
labor o
shortage o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
Palau B-GPE
relies o
on o
" o
imports o
" o
for o
most o
of o
its o
labor o
as o
well o
, o
and o
there o
are o
6000 o
foreign o
workers o
in o
the o
country o
. o

Lin B-PER
concludes o
: o
" o
Tourism o
is o
still o
the o
best o
investment o
in o
Palau B-GPE
right o
now o
. o
" o

Early o
Taiwanese o
investors o
have o
certainly o
been o
proved o
perspicacious o
, o
since o
Palau B-GPE
's o
pollution o
- o
free o
environment o
is o
its o
greatest o
asset o
. o

Diving o
aficionados o
have o
hailed o
Palau B-GPE
as o
the o
greatest o
of o
the o
seven o
wonders o
of o
the o
deep o
. o

Its o
waters o
support o
more o
than o
700 o
varieties o
of o
coral o
and o
1500 o
varieties o
of o
fish o
. o

The o
ocean o
water o
is o
warm o
and o
the o
currents o
are o
moderate o
, o
making o
for o
ideal o
diving o
conditions o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
there o
is o
a o
great o
deal o
of o
shallow o
water o
, o
which o
is o
tailor o
- o
made o
for o
snorkeling o
, o
so o
that o
even o
tourists o
who o
are o
not o
particularly o
at o
home o
in o
the o
water o
can o
enjoy o
the o
magnificence o
of o
the o
ocean o
. o

Especially o
noteworthy o
is o
" o
Blue B-LOC
Corner I-LOC
, o
" o
one o
of o
the o
most o
famous o
snorkeling o
locations o
in o
the o
world o
. o

And o
it o
is o
not o
only o
the o
ocean o
that o
is o
beautiful o
; o
Palau B-GPE
's o
land o
scenery o
is o
also o
absorbing o
. o

a o

, o
while o
the o
remains o
of o

. o

These o
islands o
have o
great o
potential o
as o
sites o
for o
historical o
tourism o
. o

In o
the o
air o
, o
because o
Palau B-GPE
is o
a o
tropical o
ocean o
climate o
, o
and o
rains o
leave o
as o
fast o
as o
they o
come o

says o
that o

have o
even o
seen o
three o
rainbows o
at o
one o

And o
if o
there o
has o
been o
no o

, o
you o
can o
see o
a o
kind o
of o
horizontal o
rainbow o
by o
standing o
on o
the o
beach o
at o
sunset o
and o
following o
with o
your o
eyes o
the o
different o
shades o
of o
blue o
of o
the o
receding o
ocean o
as o
they o
merge o
into o
the o
bands o
of o
reds o
in o
the o
evening o

In o
these o
islands o
surrounded o
by o
coral o
, o
which o
are o
virtually o
always o
calm o
and o
windless o
, o
you o
can o
be o
pulled o
into o
the o
sky o
under o
a o

and o
have o
a o
whiff o
of o
what o

of o

Reinvigorating o
the o

Lin B-PER
Neng I-PER
- I-PER
jong I-PER
says o
there o
are o
two o
viable o
directions o
to o
get o
into o
the o
Palau B-GPE
tourism o
industry o
. o

One o
is o
to o
invest o
in o
a o
tourism o
- o
related o
industry o
in o
Palau B-GPE
, o
the o
other o
is o
to o
increase o
the o
number o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
tourists o
and o
extend o
profit o
opportunities o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
itself o
. o

Oddly o
, o
despite o
Palau B-GPE
's o
beauty o
, o
in o
the o
past o
few o
years o
tourism o
has o
dropped o
off o
considerably o
. o

In o
1997 o
, o
there o
were o
more o
than o
70,000 o
foreign o
visits o
to o
Palau B-GPE
. o

Last o
year o
the o
figure o
was o
50,000 o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
has o
been o
, o
along o
with o
Japan B-GPE
, o
one o
of o
the o
main o
sources o
of o
tourists o
to o
Palau B-GPE
. o

In o
1997 o
, o
the o
number o
of o
Taiwanese o
visitors o
peaked o
at o
more o
than o
30,000 o
annually o
, o
but o
now o
is o
down o
to o
well o
below o
20,000 o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
tourism o
businesses o
in o
Palau B-GPE
, o
which o
mainly o
cater o
to o
Taiwanese B-GPE
, o
are o
crying o
uncle o
. o

" o
It o
's o
not o
only o
the o
hotel o
industry o
, o
even o
at o
Chinese o

business o
has o
fallen o
off o

says o
that o
a o
major o
reason o
why o

is o
that o

no o

a o
destination o

Hsu B-PER

East I-ORG
Airlines I-ORG
, o
which o

the o
Taiwan B-GPE
- o
to o
- o
Palau B-GPE
route o
, o
raised o
the o
price o
of o
a o
ticket o
by o
over o
NT$ o
3000 o
two o
years o
ago o
, o
citing o
inadequate o
passenger o
demand o
and o
high o
costs o
. o

This o
made o
Palau B-GPE
much o
less o
competitive o
compared o
to o
other o
places o
such o
as o
Guam B-GPE
, o
Bali B-GPE
, o
and o
Phuket B-GPE

Hsu B-PER
concludes o
: o
" o
If o
the o
price o
is o
raised o
for o
tour o
groups o
, o
no o
one o
is o
interested o
, o
but o
if o
the o
original o
price o
is o
maintained o
, o
the o
tour o
operators o
' o
profit o
falls o
too o
low o

A o

which o

in o
Pacific B-LOC
Island I-LOC
tours o
, o
says o
that o
the o
current o
trend o
among o
travelers o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
for o
low o
group o
fares o
with o
lots o
of o
entertainment o
provided o
. o

Most o
people o
who o
go o
on o
island o
vacations o
are o
looking o
for o
pure o
recreation o
, o
so o
they o
would o
prefer o
to o
be o
somewhere o
where o
the o
facilities o
are o
more o
developed o
. o

Though o
Palau B-GPE
is o
rich o
in o
natural o
attractions o
, o
it o
lacks o
peripheral o
tourist o
facilities o
like o
pubs o
, o
shopping o
centers o
, o
and o
gift o
shops o
, o
so o
naturally o
the o
islands o
are o
less o
attractive o
. o

Despite o
all o
this o
, o
James B-PER
Yeh I-PER
notes o
that o
the o
rate o
of o
return o
visitors o
to o
Palau B-GPE
is o
very o
high o
, o
more o
than o
30 o
% o
. o

Clearly o
the o
island o
is o
still o
very o
appealing o
. o

If o
the o
problems o
of o
high o
group o
rates o
and o
inadequate o
facilities o
can o
be o
solved o
, o
there o
is o
enormous o
potential o
yet o
in o
Palau B-GPE

The o
Palauan o
government o
is o
working o
hard o
to o
eliminate o
obstacles o
to o
solving o
the o
above o
problems o

says o
that o
the o

is o
going o
forward o
on o
a o
new o
airport o
and o
a o
number o
of o

They o
are o
also o

a o

from o

Taiwan B-GPE

to o
lower o

and o
reduce o

In o

, o
the o
PVA B-ORG
now o
has o
a o

Gone o

In o
the o
current o
wave o
of o
interest o
in o
investment o
in o
Palau B-GPE
, o
the o
fisheries o
industry o
is o
also o
getting o
attention o
. o

Currently o
, o
there o
's o
only o
one o
Taiwanese o
business o
person o
in o
the o
fishing o
industry o
in o
Palau B-GPE
- o
Tai B-PER
Jung I-PER
- I-PER
fei I-PER
- o
so o
profits o
are o
quite o
good o
. o

" o
At o
first o
I o
was o
in o
business o
with o
a o
bunch o
of o
friends o
, o
and o
we o
rented o
eight o
fishing o
boats o
, o
but o
profits o
were o
only o
ordinary o
. o

After o
my o
friends o
pulled o
out o
of o
the o
operation o
, o
I o
switched o
over o
to o
mainly o
running o
a o
base o
for o
fishing o
boats o
. o
" o

Little o
did o
he o
expect o
that o
profits o
would o
be o
much o
larger o
, o
especially o
after o
the o
company o
acquired o
local o
fishing o
rights o
for o
75 o
years o
. o

During o
the o
peak o
season o
from o
May o
to o
October o
, o
more o
than o
ten o
tuna o
ships o
come o
in o
every o
day o
to o
offload o
their o
catch o
and o
to o
resupply o
. o

These o
days o
, o
Tai B-PER
's o
Palau B-ORG
Marine I-ORG
Industries I-ORG
covers o
an o
area o
of o
1.5 o
acres o
and o
employs o
more o
than o
40 o
staff o
. o

It o
offers o
advanced o
freezing o
facilities o
and o
two o
aircraft o
, o
guaranteeing o
to o
deliver o
tuna o
fresh o
to o
the o
Japanese o
market o
within o
24 o
hours o
. o

However o
, o
though o
Tai B-PER
has o
made o
quite o
a o
name o
for o
himself o
with o
his o
business o
, o
this o
does o
not o
necessarily o
mean o
that o
other o
Taiwanese o
can o
come o
and o
make o
similar o
investments o

Koo B-PER
Kuang I-PER
- I-PER
ming I-PER
, o
chairman o
of o
Koo B-PER

Holdings B-ORG
Company I-ORG
Ltd. I-ORG
, o
which o
operates o
fishing o
boats o
in o
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
, o
explains o
that o
South B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
fishing o
is o
divided o
into o
two o
types o
- o
net o
fishing o
, o
and o
line o
fishing o
of o
tuna o
. o

Palau B-GPE
is o
not o
really o
suited o
to o
the o
former o
, o
because o
its o
territorial o
waters o
are o
not o
large o
, o
so o
the o
catch o
is o
limited o
. o

On o
the o
other o
hand o
, o
tuna o
stocks o
there o
are o
high o
, o
so o
Palau B-GPE
is o
more o
suited o
to o
line o
fishing o
. o

But o
the o
problem o
is o
that o
Tai B-PER
Jung I-PER
- I-PER
fei I-PER
is o
already o
running o
a o
tuna o
base o
there o
, o
and o
it o
is o
debatable o
whether o
there o
is o
the o
need o
for o
another o
one o
. o

Koo B-PER
warns o
: o
" o
It o
's o
hard o
to o
estimate o
the o
potential o
catch o
. o

If o
there o
were o
several o
firms o
, o
the o
risk o
would o
be o
much o
greater o
. o
" o

In o
addition o
, o
though o
there o
are o
many o
varieties o
of o
fish o
around o
Palau B-GPE
, o
the o
scale o
of o
operations o
is o
small o
, o
and o
markets o
are o
far o
away o
, o
so o
the o
return o
on o
investment o
would o
not o
necessarily o
be o
very o
high o
. o

Koo B-PER
points o
instead o
to o
a o
different o
option o
: o
The o
waters o
around o
Palau B-GPE
are o
clear o
and o
warm o
, o
which o
makes o
them o
suited o
to o
aquaculture o
. o

So o
far o
, o
returns o
from o
the o
small o
- o
scale o
aquaculture o
of o
scallops o
have o
been o
decent o
. o

Koo B-PER
cautions o
, o
however o
, o
that o
" o
if o
you o
want o
to o
invest o
, o
you o
have o
to o
go o
large o
- o
scale o
, o
because o
after o
all o
Palau B-GPE
is o
far o
from o
the o
main o
markets o

Palau B-GPE
Free I-GPE
Trade I-GPE
Zone I-GPE

In o
1986 o
, o
Palau B-GPE
, o
like o
many o
former o
American o
- o
controlled o
trust o
territories o
, o
signed o
a o
" o
Compact o
of o
Free o
Association o
" o
with o
the o
US B-GPE
. o

The o
agreement o
allows o
Palauan o
products o
to o
enter o
the o
States B-GPE
tax o
- o
free o
, o
and o
there o
are o
no o
quota o
limits o
for o
such o
things o
as o
textiles o
. o

For o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
a o
major o
producer o
of o
textiles o
and o
electronics o
, o
this o
is o
a o
very o
strong o
investment o
incentive o
. o

Currently o
Japanese o
and o
Taiwanese o
business o
people o
are o
negotiating o
with o
the o
Palauan o
government o
to o
establish o
a B-GPE
Palau I-GPE
Free I-GPE
Trade I-GPE
Zone I-GPE
. o

The o
idea o
is o
for o
Palau B-GPE
to o
designate o
a o
special o
zone o
for o
economic o
development o
, o
with o
the o
Palau B-GPE
government o
providing o
tax o
and o
land o
- o
use o
incentives o
. o

The o
zone o
would o
be o
for o
processing o
of o
exports o
, o
mainly o
in o
textiles o
and o
electronics o
, o
and o
mainly o
to o
the o
US B-GPE
market o

Felix B-PER
Yen I-PER
, o
president o
of o
the B-ORG

An I-ORG
Palau I-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
, o
which o
is o
handling o
the o
Hung B-PER
Kuo I-PER
project o
, o
is o
very o
familiar o
with o
the o
business o
climate o
in o
Palau B-GPE
. o

He o
says o
that o
right o
now o
the o
main o
obstacles o
to o
foreign o
investment o
are o
land o
acquisition o
and o
communications o
. o

Under o
Palauan o
law o
foreigners o
are o
not o
allowed o
to o
own o
land o
there o
, o
but o
can o
only o
lease o
land o
for o
development o
. o

The o
longest o
permitted o
lease o
is o
50 o
years o
. o

But o
even o
leasing o
is o
a o
complicated o
matter o
, o
because o
traditionally o
land o
in o
Palau B-GPE
is o
owned o
jointly o
by o
the o
family o
and o
the o
clan o
. o

Moreover o
, o
communications o
and o
Internet o
access o
are o
not o
very o
reliable o
. o

All o
of o
these o
problems o
deter o
investors o
. o

Though o
the o
communications o
problems o
may o
be o
resolved o
within o
a o
few o
years o
- o
the o
government o
has o
received o
US B-GPE
assistance o
for o
priority o
construction o
of o
electricity o
and o
fiber o

facilities o
- o

still o
cautions o
those o
interested o
in o
signing o
on o
to o
the o
free o
trade o
zone o
plan o
to o
" o
be o
prudent o
. o
" o

" o
The o
point o
to o
watch o
out o
for o
in o
the o
whole o
plan o
is o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
firms o
may o
not o
understand o
that o
it o
might o
not o
be o
all o
that o
good o
a o
deal o
from o
the o
point o
of o
view o
of o
the o
Palau B-GPE
authorities o
, o
" o
he o
says o
. o

Currently o
foreign o
firms o
are o
more o
pro-active o
than o
the o
Palauan o
government o
, o
which o
has o
its o
own o
concerns o
: o
The o
indigenous o
population o
is o
small o
, o
and o
there o
could o
be o
social o
problems o
if o
a o
large o
number o
of o
foreign o
workers o
come o
to o
the o
islands o
. o

Also o
, o
the o
government o
must o
weigh o
economic o
development o
against o
environmental o
destruction o
. o

" o
The o
terms o
under o
which o
Palau B-GPE
would o
accept o
the o
proposed o
zone o
may o
not o
be o
as o
good o
as o
many o
Taiwan B-GPE
business o
people o
optimistically o
expect o
. o
" o

Looking o
at o
the o
larger o
picture o
, o
however o
, o
there o
are o
many o
areas o
and o
ways o
to o
invest o
. o

A o
careful o
look o
will o
show o
that o
Palau B-GPE
has o
many o
pearls o
. o

a o

Unique o
investment o
opportunities o
like o
these o
are o
waiting o
to o
be o
taken o
up o
by o

Perhaps o
Palau B-GPE
is o
, o
as o

made o
an o
acute o
observation o
about o
Yeh B-PER
: o

Although o
it o
was o
her o
husband o
's o
lingering o
shadow o
that o
took o
her o
into o
politics o
, o
Yeh B-PER
's o
performance o
has o
gone o
beyond o
the o
traditional o
experiences o
of o
women o
in o
opposition o
politics o
, o
transcending o
the o
image o
of o
a o
victimized o
family o
member o
to o
manifest o
the o
autonomy o
of o
a o
female o
political o
figure o
in o
her o
own o
right o

Peng B-PER
commented o
: o
" o
During o
her o
first o
term o
as o
a o
legislator o
she o
acted o
a o
lot o
like o
a o
substitute o
, o
so o
every o
time o
she o
questioned o
officials o
or o
addressed o
a o
session o
she o
would o
say o
that o

and o
such o
was o
communicated o
to o
her o
in o

However o
, o
by o
her o
second o
and o
third o
terms o
, o
she o
came o
very o
much o
into o
her o
own o
, o
and o
she o
won o
great o
respect o
from o
women o
's o
groups o
as o
a o
defender o
of o

gave o
a o
short o
interview o
, o
stressing o
, o
" o
When o
I o

I o
was o
not o
playing o
the o
role o
of o
a o

I o
was o
already o
an o
influential o
female o
executive o
in o
my o
professional o
field o
. o

And o
even o
though o
I o
went o
into o
politics o
due o
to o
my o
husband o
's o
sacrifice o
, o
I o
was o
only o
willing o
to o
do o
so o
because o
I o
shared o
his o
beliefs o
. o

My o
objective o
was o
to o
fight o
as o
a o
mother o
for o
what o
I o
hold o
dearest o

As o
a o
public o

exhaustive o

The o
revision o
of o
the o

a o

providing o
safeguards o
for o

not o
just o
to o

an o

to o
witness o
the o
flowering o
of o

and o
the o
dawn o
of o
a o

On o
the o

of o

the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
completed o
a o
historic o
alternation o
of o
political o

in o

This o
is o

of o

in o
the o
history o
of o
the B-GPE

an o
epochal o

for o

Taiwan B-GPE
has o
not o
only o
set o
a o
new o
model o
for o
the o
Asian o
experience o
of o

has o
also o
added o
an o

election o
for o
the o
10th o

term o
president o
of o
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
has o
clearly o
shown o
the o
world o
that o
the o
fruits o
of o
freedom o

by o

dispelled o

outcome o
of o

2000 o
presidential o
election o

not o
the o
victory o
of o
an o

a o

It o
is o
a o
victory o
of o
the o
people o
as o
well o
as o
a o
victory o
for o

, o
because o
we o
have o
, o

transcended o

bravely o

Dear o

let o
's o
always o

this o
moment o

let o
's o
always o
remember o
to o
value o

for o
it o

because o
the o
fruits o
of o

did o
not o
come o
out o
of o
the o
blue o

reaped o
the o
fruits o
only o
after o
we o
had o
been o
subjected o
to o
many o
perils o
and o
countless o
hardships o

If o
not o
for o
the o
fearless o

of o
our o

if o
not o
for o
the o
unswerving o
faith o
of o
the o
tens o
of o
millions o
of o
Taiwanese o
people o
in o

we o
could o
not o
possibly o
be o
standing o
on o
our o

celebrating o
a o
glorious o
occasion o
that o

Today o
, o
it o
is o
as o
if o
we o
are o
standing o
before o
a o
fresh o
new o
gate o
of o
history o
. o

In o
the o
process o
of o
democratization o
, o
the o
Taiwanese o
people o
have o
created o
a o
brand o
- o
new o
key o
to o
our o
shared o
destiny o
. o

The o
new o
century o
's o
gates o
of o
hope o
are o
soon o
to o
open o
. o

We o
are o
humble o
but o
not o
submissive o
. o

We o
are o
full o
of o
self o
- o
confidence o
but o
do o
not o
have o
the o
slightest o
bit o
of o
complacence o
. o

Since o
that o
moment o
on o
March o
18 o
when o
the o
election o
results o
came o
to o
light o
, o
I o
have o
accepted o
the o
mandate o
of o
all o
Taiwanese o
people o
in o
a o
most o
earnest o
and o
humble o
frame o
of o
mind o
, o
and o
have o
vowed o
to o
devote o
all o
my o
heart o
, o
knowledge o
and o
courage o
to o
assuming o
the o
heavy o
responsibility o
for o
our o
country o
's o
future o
. o

I o
personally o
understand o
that o
the o
significance o
of o
the o
alternation o
of o
political o
parties o
and o
of o
the o
peaceful o
transition o
of o
power o
lies o
not o
in o
that o
it o
is o
a o
change o
of o
personnel o
or o
political o
parties o
. o

Nor o
in o
that o
it o
is o
a o
dynastic o
change o
. o

Rather o
, o
it o
is o
the o
return o
of o
state o
and o
government o
power o
to o
the o
people o
through o
a o
democratic o
procedure o
. o

The o
country o
belongs o
to o
the o
people o
, o
rather o
than o
to o
any o
individual o
or o
political o
party o
. o

The o
government o
and o
its o
officials o
, o
from o
the o
head o
of o
state o
down o
to o
the o
rank o
- o
and o
- o
file o
employees o
, o
exist o
for o
the o
service o
of o
the o
people o
. o

The o
alternation o
of o
political o
parties o
does o
not o
mean o
an o
across o
- o
the o
- o
board o
negation o
of o
the o
past o
. o

We o
should o
be o
fair o
in o
evaluating o
the o
contributions o
made o
by o
those o
in o
power o
throughout o
the o
ages o
. o

Mr. o
Lee B-PER
Teng I-PER
- I-PER
hui I-PER
deserves o
our o
highest o
tribute o
and o
heartfelt o
gratitude o
for o
his o
promotion o
of o
democratic o
reforms o
and o
for o
his o
excellent o
performance o
during o
his o
twelve o
years o
of o
leadership o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
society o
has o
rallied o
and o
participated o
energetically o
in o
the o
election o
. o

Despite o
the o
diverse o
views o
and o
stances o
, o
all o
individuals o
share o
the o
same o
commitment o
- o
to o
come o
forward o
for o
the o
sake o
of o
their o
political o
ideas o
and o
the o
country o
's o
future o
. o

We o
believe o
that o
the o
end o
of o
an o
election o
is o
the o
beginning o
of o
reconciliation o
. o

After o
the o
curtain o
falls o
on o
emotional o
campaigns o
, o
rationality o
should o
prevail o
. o

Under o
the o
supreme o
principles o
of o
national o
interest o
and o
the o
welfare o
of o
the o
people o
, o
those o
in o
power o
and o
in o
opposition o
should o
both o
fulfill o
their o
mandates o
given o
by o
the o
people o
and o
realize o
the o
ideals o
of o
fair o
competition o
in o
multiparty o
politics o
, o
as o
well o
as o
the o
checks o
and o
balances o
of o
democratic o
politics o
. o

A o
democratic o
society o
with o
fair o
competition o
, o
tolerance o
and o
trust o
is o
the o
strongest o
impetus o
for o
a o
nation o
's o
development o
. o

Placing o
national o
interests o
above o
those o
of o
political o
parties o
, o
we o
should o
solidify o
the o
will o
of o
the o
people o
and o
seek o
consensus o
among o
the o
ruling o
and o
opposition o
parties o
, o
to o
promote o
the o
country o
's o
progress o
and o
reforms o

A o
government o
for o
all o
people o
" o
and o
" o
rule o
by o
the o
clean o
and o
upright o
" o
are o
promises o
I o
made o
to o
the o
people o
during o
the o
campaign o
period o
. o

They o
are o
also o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
key o
to o
stepping o
over o
its o
fault o
lines o
and o
rising o
to o
a o
higher o
level o
in o
the o
future o
. o

The o
spirit o
of o
" o
a o
government o
for o
all o
people o
" o
lies o
in o
the o
fact o
that o
" o
the o
government o
exists o
for o
the o
people o
. o
" o

The o
people o
are o
the o
masters o
and o
shareholders o
of o
the o
state o
. o

The o
government o
should o
rule o
on o
the o
basis o
of o
majority o
public o
opinion o
. o

The o
interests o
of o
the o
people o
should o
reign o
supreme o
over o
those o
of o
any o
political o
party o
or o
individual o
. o

have o
always o
taken o
pride o
in o
being o
a o
member o

but o
from o
the o
moment o
I o
take o
my o

I o
will o
put o
all o
my o
efforts o
into o
fulfilling o
my o
role o
as o
a o

president o
for o
all o

As o
in o
the o
formation o
of o
the o
new o
government o
, o
we o
recruit o
people o
according o
to o
their o
talents o
and o
do o
not o
discriminate o
on o
the o
basis o
of o
ethnicity o
, o
gender o
or o
party o
affiliation o
. o

The o
welfare o
of o
the o
populace o
shall o
be o
our o
primary o
goal o
in o
the o
future o
. o

" o
Rule o
by o
the o
clean o

" o
has o
as o
its o
topmost o
priority o
the o
elimination o

the o

For o
a o
long o

have o
been o
deeply o

Vote o
- o
buying o
in o
grassroots o
elections o
has o
also o
robbed o
the o
people o
of o
their o
right o
to o
elect o
the o
wise o
and o
the o
able o
, o
and o
tainted o
the o
development o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
democracy o
. o

Today o
, o
I o
am o
willing o
to o
promise o
that o
the o
new o
government o
will o
eliminate o
vote o
- o
buying o
and o
crack o
down o
on o
" o
black o
gold o
" o
politics o
, o
so o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
can o
rise o
above o
such o
sinking o
forces o
and o
ensure o
rule o
by o
the o
clean o
and o
upright o
. o

We o
must o
give o
the o
people o
a o
clean o
political o
environment o
. o

In o
the o
area o
of o
government o
reforms o
, o
we o
need o
to o
establish o
a o
government o
that o
is o
clean o
, o
efficient o
, o
far o
- o
sighted o
, o
dynamic o
, o
highly o
flexible o
and o
responsive o
, o
in o
order o
to o
ensure o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
competitiveness o
in o
the o
face o
of o
increasingly o
fierce o
global o
competition o
. o

The o
age o
of o
" o
large o
and o
capable o
" o
governments o
has o
now o
passed o
, o
replaced o
by o
one o
of o
" o
small o
and o
effective o
" o
governments o
, o
which o
have o
established o
partnership o
relations o
with o
the o
people o
. o

We o
should o
accelerate o
the o
streamlining o
of o
government o
functions o
and o
organization o
and o
actively o
expand o
the o
role o
of o
public o
participation o
. o

This o
will o
not o
only o
allow o
the o
public o
to o
fully o
utilize o
its o
energy o
but o
also o
significantly o
reduce o
the o
government o
's o
burdens o
. o

Similar o
partnership o
relations o
should o
also o
be o
set o
up o
between o
the o
central o
and o
local o
governments o
. o

We o
want o
to o
break o
the o
authoritarian o
and o
centralized o
control o
over o
both o
power o
and o
money o
. o

We o
want o
to o
realize o
the o
spirit o
of o
local o
autonomy o
, o
where o
the o
local o
and o
central o
governments o
share o
resources o
and o
responsibilities o
, o
where o
" o
the o
central o
government o
will o
not o
do o
what o
the o
local o
governments o
can o
. o
" o

Whether o
in o
the o
east o
, o
west o
, o
north o
or o
south o
, o
whether o
on o
Taiwan B-GPE
proper o
or o
on o
offshore o
islands o
, o
all o
will o
enjoy o
balanced o
, o
pluralistic o
development o
, o
and o
the o
gap o
between o
urban o
and o
rural o
areas o
will o
be o
reduced o
. o

We o
should o
understand o
that o
the o
government o
is o
no o
panacea o
for o
all o
ills o
. o

The o
driving o
force o
for o
economic o
development o
and o
societal o
progress o
is o
the o
people o
. o

Over o
the o
past o
half o
- o
century o
, o
the o
Taiwanese o
people o
have o
toiled o
hard o
to o
create o
an o
economic o
miracle o
that o
has o
won o
global o
applause o
, o
and o
to o
lay o
the o
foundation o
for o
the o
survival o
and o
development o
of o
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
. o

Today o
, o
facing o
the o
impact o
of o
fast o
- o
changing o
information o
technologies o
and o
trade o
liberalization o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
must o
move o
toward o
a o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
. o

High o
- o
tech o
industries o
need o
to o
be o
constantly o
innovative o
, o
while o
traditional o
ones o
have o
to o
undergo o
transformation o
and o
upgrading o
. o

In o
the o
future o
, o
the o
government o
should o
not o
necessarily o
play o
the o
role o
of o
a o
" o
leader o
" o
or o
" o
manager o
. o
" o

On o
the o
contrary o
, o
it o
should o
be o
the o
" o
supporter o
" o
and o
" o
service o
provider o
, o
" o
as o
expected o
by o
private o
enterprises o
. o

The o
responsibility o
of o
a o
modern o
government o
is o
to o
raise o
administrative o
efficiency o
, o
improve o
the o
domestic o
investment o
environment o
, o
and o
maintain o
financial o
order o
and o
stock o
market o
stability o
, o
so o
as o
to o
allow o
the o
economy o
to o
move o
toward o
full o
liberalization o
and o
globalization o
through o
fair o
competition o
. o

Based o
on o
these o
principles o
, o
the o
vitality o
of o
the o
public o
will o
naturally o
bloom o
and o
create o
a o
new o
phase o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
economic o
miracle o
. o

Apart o
from o
consolidating o
democratic o
achievements o
, o
promoting o
government o
reforms o
, o
and o
raising o
economic o
competitiveness o
, o
the o
new o
government o
should o
, o
as o
its o
foremost o
objective o
, o
closely o
watch o
public o
opinion o
and o
implement o
reforms o
accordingly o
, o
so o
that o
the o
people o
on o
this o
land o
can o
live o
with o
more o
dignity o
, o
greater o
self o
- o
confidence o
and o
a o
better o
quality o
of o
life o
. o

Let o
our o
society o
not o
only o
be o
safe o
, o
harmonious o
and o
prosperous o
, o
but o
also o
follow o
the o
principles o
of o
fairness o
and o
justice o
. o

As o
we o
cultivate o
the o
ever o
- o
growing o
abilities o
of o
our o
citizens o
, o
we o
will o
let o
our o
next o
generation o
learn o
in o
an o
environment o
filled o
with o
happiness o
and o
hope o
. o

The o
21st o
century o
will o
be o
a o
time o
when o
" o
the o
right o
to o
a o
quality o
life o
" o
and o
" o
a o
refined o
way o
of o
life o
" o
are o
much o
emphasized o
. o

The o
government o
will o
find o
solutions o
for o
issues o
relating o
to o
the o
people o
's o
lives o
, o
such o
as o
law o
and o
order o
, o
social o
welfare o
, o
environmental o
protection o
, o
land o
- o
use o
planning o
, o
waste o
disposal o
, o
river o
cleaning o
, o
transportation o
and o
community o
renewal o
. o

It o
will o
also o
have o
to o
implement o
these o
solutions o
thoroughly o
. o

At o
present o
, o
we o
need o
to o
immediately o
improve o
law o
and o
order o
and o
environmental o
protection o
, o
two o
important o
indicators o
of o
the o
quality o
of o
life o
. o

We o
will o
build o
a o
new o
social o
order o
so o
that o
the o
people o
may o
live o
in o
peace o
without o
fear o
. o

A o
balance o
must o
be o
ensured o
between o
nature o
conservation o
and o
economic o
development o
so o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
may o
develop o
into o
a o
sustainable o
green o
silicon o
island o
. o

Judicial o
integrity o
is o
the o
bulwark o
of o
political o
democracy o
and o
social o
justice o
. o

An o
impartial o
, o
independent o
judiciary o
is o
a o
protector o
of o
social o
order o
and o
a o
defender o
of o
the o
people o
's o
rights o
. o

At o
present o
, o
we o
still o
have o
a o
long o
way o
to o
go o
in o
our o
judicial o
reforms o
. o

Our o
compatriots o
must o
continue o
to o
keep o
close o
watch o
over o
the o
judiciary o
and o
voice o
their o
expectations o
. o

At o
the o
same o
time o
, o
we o
should o
also o
restrain o
our o
administrative o
power o
and o
give o
the o
judiciary o
room o
to o
operate o
independently o
and o
without o
interference o
. o

Humans o
are o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
most o
important o
resources o
. o

Talented o
people o
hold o
the o
key o
to o
the o
country o
's o
competitiveness o
, o
while o
education o
is o
the o
long o
- o
term o
cause o
underpinning o
" o
accumulating o
wealth o
among o
the o
people o
. o
" o

We o
will o
soon o
seek o
a o
consensus o
among o
the o
ruling o
and o
opposition o
parties o
, o
academia o
and o
the o
public o
so o
as o
to o
carry o
on o
with o
educational o
reforms o
and o
build o
a o
healthy o
, o
proactive o
, o
lively o
and o
innovative o
educational o
system o
, o
which o
will o
allow o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
cultivate o
an o
uninterrupted o
stream o
of o
top o
- o
notch o
talents o
amid o
the o
fierce o
international o
competition o
. o

We o
will o
let o
Taiwan B-GPE
move o
gradually o
toward o
being o
a o
" o
learning o
organism o
" o
and o
a o
" o
knowledge o
- o
based o
society o
. o
" o

We o
will o
also o
encourage o
people o
to o
take o
up o
lifetime o
learning o
to o
fully o
develop o
their o
potential o
and o
creativity o
. o

Grassroots o
community o
organizations o
are o
now o
developing o
around o
the o
country o
, o
working o
to o
explore o
and o
preserve o
the o
history o
, o
culture o
, o
geography o
and o
ecology o
of o
their o
localities o
. o

These o
are o
all o
part o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
culture o
, o
whether o
they o
are o
local o
cultures o
, o
mass o
cultures o
or o
high o
cultures o
. o

Due o
to o
special o
historical o
and o
geographical o
factors o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
possesses o
a o
wealth o
of o
diversified o
cultural o
elements o
. o

But o
cultural o
development o
is o
not o
something o
that o
can o
bring o
immediate o
success o
. o

Rather o
, o
it o
has o
to o
be o
accumulated o
bit o
by o
bit o
. o

We o
must o
open o
our o
hearts o
with o
tolerance o
and o
respect o
, o
so o
that o
our o
diverse o
ethnic o
groups o
and o
different o
regional o
cultures o
may o
communicate o
with o
each o
other o
, o
and o
so o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
local o
cultures o
may o
connect o
with o
the o
cultures o
of o
Chinese o
- o
speaking o
communities o
and o
other o
world o
cultures o
, o
and o
create o
a o
new o
milieu o
of o

in o

The o
September o
21 o
earthquake o
that o
struck o
last o
year o
brought o
to o
our o
land o
and o
our o
compatriots o
an o
unprecedented o
catastrophe o
, o
the o
pain o
of o
which o
is o
yet o
to o
heal o
. o

The o
new o
government o
will o
brook o
no o
delay o
in o
the o
reconstruction o
of o
disaster o
areas o
, o
including o
industrial o
and o
spiritual o
recovery o
. o

We o
will o
not o
cease o
until o
the o
last o
victim o
is o
taken o
care o
of o
and o
the o
last o
destroyed o
place o
is o
rebuilt o
. o

Here o
, o
we o
would o
like o
to o
express o
our o
highest o
respect o
again o
for o
all o
individuals o
and o
nongovernmental o
organizations o
that o
have o
selflessly o
lent o
a o
hand o
to o
the o
rescue o
and o
reconstruction o
work o
after o
the o
disaster o
. o

Amid o
the o
fierce o
power o
of o
Nature o
, o
we o
have o
seen o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
most o
beautiful o
compassion o
, o
strongest o
faith o
and o
greatest o
trust o
. o

Our o
compatriots o
have o
been o
injured o
by o
the o
September o
21 o
earthquake o
, o
but o
with o
the o
spirit o
of o
a o
" o
volunteer o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
" o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
new o
family o
will o
stand o
up o
resolutely o
on o
its o
feet o
once o
again o
. o

Dear o
compatriots o
, o
400 o
years o
ago o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
called o
" o
Ihla B-GPE
Formosa I-GPE
" o
- o
the o
beautiful o
island o
- o
for o
its o
lustrous o
landscape o
. o

Today o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
manifesting o
the o
elegance o
of o
a o
democratic o
island o
, o
once o
again o
attracting o
global o
attention o
, o
as o
the o
people o
on o
this o
land o
create o
a o
new o
page o
in o
our o
history o
. o

We o
believe o
that o
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
, o
with o
its o
democratic o
achievements o
and o
technological o
and o
economic o
prowess o
, o
can o
certainly o
continue o
to o
play o
an o
indispensable o
role o
in o
the o
international o
community o
. o

In o
addition o
to o
strengthening o
the o
existing o
relations o
with o
friendly o
nations o
, o
we o
want o
to o
actively o
participate o
in o
all o
types o
of o
international o
nongovernmental o
organizations o
. o

Through o
humanitarian o
care o
, o
economic o
cooperation o
, o
cultural o
exchanges o
and o
various o
other o
ways o
, o
we o
will o
actively o
participate o
in o
international o
affairs o
, o
expand o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
room o
for o
survival o
in o
the o
international o
arena o
, o
and o
contribute o
to o
the o
welfare o
of o
the o
international o
community o
. o

Besides o
, o
we o
are o
also o
willing o
to o
commit o
to o
a o
more o
active o
contribution o
in o
safeguarding o
international o
human o
rights o
. o

The B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
can o
not o
and o
will o
not o
remain o
outside o
global o
human o
rights o
trends o
. o

We o
will o
abide o
by o
the o
Universal o
Declaration o
of o
Human o
Rights o
, o
the o
International o
Convention o
for o
Civil o
and o
Political o
Rights o
, o
and o
the o
Vienna o
Declaration o
and o
Program o
of o
Action o
. o

We o
will o
bring o
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
back o
into o
the o
international o
human o
rights o
system o
. o

The o
new o
government o
will o
urge o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
to o
ratify o
the o
International o
Bill o
of o
Rights o
as o
a o
domestic o
law o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
so o
that o
it o
will o
formally o
become o
the o
" o
Taiwan o
Bill o
of o
Rights o
. o
" o

We o
hope o
to o
set o
up o
an o
independent o
national o
human o
rights o
commission o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
thereby o
realizing o
an o
action o
long o
advocated o
by o
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. o

We o
will o
also o
invite o
two o
outstanding o
nongovernmental o
organizations o
, o
the B-ORG
International I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
of I-ORG
Jurists I-ORG
and o
Amnesty B-ORG
International I-ORG
, o
to o
assist o
us o
in o
our o
measures o
to o
protect o
human o
rights o
and o
make o
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
China I-GPE
into o
a o
new o
indicator o
for o
human o
rights o
in o
the o
21st o
century o
. o

We o
firmly o
believe o
that o
at o
no o
time o
, o
nor o
in o
any o
corner o
of o
the o
world o
, o
can o
the o
meaning o
and o
values o
of o
freedom o
, o
democracy o
and o
human o
rights o
be o
ignored o
or o
changed o
. o

The o
20th o
century o
left o
us o
with o
a o
major o
lesson o
- o
that o
war o
is o
a o
failure o
of o
humanity o
. o

Waged o
for o
whatever o
lofty o
purposes o
or o
high o
- o
sounding o
reasons o
, o
war o
is o
the o
greatest o
harm o
to o
freedom o
, o
democracy o
and o
human o
rights o
. o

Over o
the o
past o
one o
hundred o
plus o
years o
, o
China B-GPE
has o
suffered o
imperialist o
aggression o
, o
which o
left o
indelible o
wounds o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
has o
had o
an o
even o
sadder o
fate o
, o
tormented o
by o
brute o
force o
and o
colonial o
rule o
. o

These o
similar o
historical o
experiences o
should o
bring o
mutual o
understanding o
between o
the o
people o
on o
the o
two o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, o
setting o
a o
solid o
foundation o
for o
pursuing o
freedom o
, o
democracy o
and o
human o
rights o
together o
. o

However o
, o
due o
to o
the o
long o
period o
of o
separation o
, o
the o
two o
sides o
have o
developed o
vastly o
different o
political o
systems o
and o
ways o
of o
life o
, o
obstructing o
empathy o
and o
friendship o
between o
the o
people o
on o
the o
two o
sides o
, o
and o
even o
creating o
a o
wall o
of o
divisiveness o
and o
confrontation o
. o

Today o
, o
as o
the o
Cold o
War o
has o
ended o
, o
it o
is o
time o
for o
the o
two o
sides o
to o
cast o
aside o
the o
hostility o
left o
from o
the o
old o
era o
. o

We o
do o
not o
need o
to o
wait o
further o
because o
there o
is o
a o
new o
opportunity o
now o
for o
the o
two o
sides o
to o
create o
an o
era o
of o
reconciliation o
together o
. o

The o
people o
on o
the o
two o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
share o
the o
same o
ancestral o
, o
cultural o
, o
and o
historical o
background o
. o

While o
upholding o
the o
principles o
of o
democracy o
and o
parity o
, o
building o
upon o
the o
existing o
foundations o
, o
and o
constructing o
conditions o
for o
cooperation o
through o
good o
will o
, o
we o
believe o
that o
the o
leaders o
on o
both o
sides o
possess o
enough o
wisdom o
and o
creativity o
to o
jointly o
deal o
with o
the o
question o
of o
a o
future o
" o
one o
China B-GPE

" o

I o
fully o
understand o
that o

China I-GPE
, o
I o
must o
abide o
by o
the o
Constitution o
, o
maintain o
the o
sovereignty o
, o
dignity o
and o
security o
of o
our o
country o
, o
and o
ensure o
the o
well o
- o
being o
of o
all o
citizens o
. o

Therefore o
, o
as o
long o
as o
the o
CCP B-ORG
regime o
has o
no o
intention o
to o
use o
military o
force o
against o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
I o
pledge o
that o
during o
my o
term o
in o
office o
, o
I o
will o
not o
declare o
independence o
, o
I o
will o
not o
change o
the o
national o
title o
, o
I o
will o
not o

inclusion o
of o

called o

" o
description o
in o
the o

, o
and o
I o
will o
not o
promote o
a o
referendum o
to o
change o
the o
status o

in o
regard o
to o
the o
question o
of o
independence o
or o
unification o
. o

Furthermore o
, o
there o
is o
no o
question o
of o
abolishing o
the o
Guidelines o
for o
National o
Unification o
and o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG

Council I-ORG
. o

History o
has o
proved o
that o
war o
will o
lead o
to o
more o
hatred o
and o
enmity o
, o
without o
the o
least o
help o
to o
the o
development o
of o
mutual o
relations o
. o

Chinese o
people o
emphasize o
the o
difference o
between o
statesmanship o
and o
hegemony o
, o
believing o
in o
the o
philosophy o
that o
a o
government o
which o
employs o
benevolence o
" o
will o
please o
those o
near o
and o
appeal o
to o
those o
from o
afar o
, o
" o
and o
" o
when o
those o
from o
afar o
will o
not o
submit o
, o
then o
one o
must o
practice o
kindness o
and o
virtue o
to o
attract o
them o
. o
" o

Such o
Chinese o
wisdom o
will o
remain o
a o
universal o
value o
. o

Under o
the o
leadership o
of o
Mr. o
Deng B-PER
Xiaoping I-PER
and o
Mr. o
Jiang B-PER
Zemin I-PER
, o
the o
mainland o
has o
created o
a o
miracle o
of o
economic o
openness o
. o

In o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
over o
a o
half o
century o
, o
not o
only o
have o
we o
created o
a o
miracle o
economy o
, o
we o
have o
also o
created o
the o
political o
marvel o
of o
democracy o
. o

On o
such o
a o
basis o
, o
as o
long o
as o
the o
governments o
and o
people o
on o
the o
two o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
can o
interact o
more o
, o
following o
the o
principles o
of o
" o
goodwill o
reconciliation o
, o
active o
cooperation o
, o
and o
permanent o
peace o
, o
" o
while o
at o
the o
same o
time o
respecting o
the o
free o
choice o
of o
the o
people o
and o
excluding o
unnecessary o
obstacles o
, o
both o
sides o
of o
the o
Strait B-LOC
can o
make o
great o
contributions o
to o
the o
prosperity o
and o
stability o
of o
the o
Asia B-LOC
- o
Pacific B-LOC
region o
. o

Both o
sides o
will o
also o
create o
a o
glorious o
civilization o
for o
humanity o
. o

Dear o
compatriots o
, o
we o
hope o
so o
much o
to o
share o
the o
moving o
scene o
of o
this o
moment o
with o
all o
Chinese o
- o
speaking o
people o
around o
the o
world o
. o

The o
wide o
Ketagelan o
Boulevard o
before o
us o
was o
bristling o
with o
security o
guards o
only o
a o
few o
years o
ago o
. o

The o
building o
behind o
me o
used o
to o
be o
the o
Governor o
General o
's o
Mansion o
during o
the o
colonial o
era o
. o

Today o
, o
we o
gather o
here o
to o
extol o
the o
glory o
and o
joy o
of o
democracy o
with o
songs o
of o
the o
land o
and o
the o
voice o
of o
the o
people o
. o

With o
a o
little o
reflection o
, o
our o
compatriots o
should o
be o
able o
to o
appreciate o
the o
deep o
and o
far o
- o
reaching o
meaning o
of o
this o
moment o
: o

Authoritarianism o
and o
force o
can o
only o
bring o
surrender o
for o
one o
time o
, o
while o
democracy o
and o
freedom o
are o
values o
that o
will o
endure o
forever o
. o

Only o
by o
adhering o
to o
the o
will o
of o
the o
people o
can o
we o
pioneer o
the o
paths o
of o
history o
and o
build o
enduring o
architecture o
. o

Today o
, o
as o
the o
son o
of o
a o
tenant o
farmer o
with o
a o
poor o
family o
background o
, o
I o
have o
struggled o
and o
grown o
on o
this o
land o
and o
, o
after o
experiencing o
defeat o
and o
tribulation o
, o
I o
have o
finally o
won o
the o
trust o
of o
the o
people o
to o
take o
up o
the o
great o
responsibility o
of o
leading o
the o
country o
. o

My o
individual o
achievements o
are o
minor o
, o
but o
the o
message o
is o
valuable o
because o
each o
citizen o
of o
Formosa B-GPE
is o
a o
" o
child o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
" o
just o
like o
me o
. o

In o
whatever o
difficult o
environment o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
will o
be o
like o
a o
selfless o
, o
loving o
mother o
, o
who o
never o
stops o
giving o
her o
children o
opportunities o
and o
who o
helps o
them o
realize o
beautiful o
dreams o
. o

The o
spirit o
of o
the o
" o
child o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
" o
reveals o
to o
us o
that o
even o
though o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
Penghu B-LOC
, o
Kinmen B-LOC
and o
Matsu B-LOC
are o
tiny o
islands o
on o
the o
rim o
of o
the o
Pacific B-LOC
, o
the o
map o
of o
our o
dreams o
knows o
no o
limits o
. o

The o
map o
extends o
all o
the o
way o
to o
the o
horizon o
as o
long o
as o
our o
23 o
million o
compatriots o
fear o
no o
hardship o
and o
move o
forward o
hand o
in o
hand o
. o

Dear o
compatriots o
, o
this o
magnificent o
moment o
belongs o
to o
all o
the o
people o
. o

All o
grace o
and o
glory o
belongs o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
- o
our o
eternal o
Mother o
. o

Together o
, o
let o
's o
extend o
our o
gratitude o
to o
the o
earth o
and o
our o
respect o
to o
the o
people o
. o

Long o
live o
freedom o
and o
democracy o
! o

Long o

of o

We o
pray o
for o

It o
is o
said o
that o
the o
two o
hottest o
subjects o
in o
post-martial o
law o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
been o
sex o
and o
personal o
money o
management o
, o
which o
certainly o
goes o
to o
show o
the o
degree o
of o
openness o
and o
pluralism o
in o
today o
's o
society o
. o

Moreover o
, o
like o
sex o
, o
personal o
money o
management o
is o
something o
that o
many o
people o
only o
vaguely o
understand o
, o
that o
they o
feel o
uncertain o
about o
committing o
themselves o
to o
, o
and o
that o
leaves o
them o
feeling o
tired o
and o
empty o
. o

Personal o
money o
management o
is o
now o
a o
national o
sport o
. o

The o
wealthy o
hope o
to o
roll o
their o
money o
over o
, o
while o
those o
less o
well o
off o
are o
trying o
to o
make o
a o
small o
pile o
of o
their o
own o
. o

But o
what o
kind o
of o
money o
management o
approach o
is o
best o
suited o
to o
the o
current o
era o
? o

How o
can o
one o
win o
in o
the o
investment o
game o
without o
losing o
the o
game o
of o
life o
in o
the o
process o
? o

" o
Earning o
money o
is o
the o
first o
priority o
, o
spending o
money o
is o
a o
sin o
, o
long o
live o
personal o
money o
management o
! o
" o

Thus o
declares o
a o
poster o
on o
the o
wall o
of o
a o
certain o
" o
Miss o
Chen B-PER
, o
" o
a o
secretary o
in o
a o
trucking o
company o
in o
Pingtung B-GPE
. o

Every o
night o
before o
going o
to o
sleep o
she o
turns o
on o
her o
computer o
to o
check o
out o
the o
closing o
share o
prices o
for o
the B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
Stock I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
and o
the o
opening o
figures o
for o
the o
US B-GPE
exchanges o
, o
and o
then o
makes o
a o
quick o
calculation o
in o
her o
head o
of o
her o
total o
wealth o
. o

This o
woman o
, o
who o
is o
nearing o
30 o
and o
has o
been o
working o
for o
seven o
years o
, o
has o
a o
" o
personal o
value o
" o
which o
is o
still o
less o
than o
NT$ o
600,000 o
, o
so o
in o
order o
to o
build o
up o
a o
fund o
for o
investing o
, o
she o
will o
not o
buy o
a o
house o
or o
go o
abroad o
for o
travel o
, o
and o
she o
's o
becoming o
a o
Scrooge o
in o
the o
eyes o
of o
her o
friends o
. o

Yet o
, o
all o
her o
discipline o
and o
her o
enthusiasm o
can o
not o
guarantee o
that o
she o
makes o
money o
. o

And o
sometimes o
when o
she o
looks o
at o
the o
poster o
on o
her o
wall o
, o
she o
feels o
as o
if o
she o
is o
being o
mocked o
. o

If o
I o
knew o
then o
what o
I o
know o
now o

Liu B-PER

, o
a o
25 o
- o
year o
- o
old o
teacher o
, o
is o
another o
e-generation o
personal o
money o
management o
enthusiast o
. o

Even o
before o
he o
did o
his o
compulsory o
military o
service o
, o
he o
began o
making o
investments o
of o
NT$ o
3,000 o
per o
month o
in o
a o
Japan B-GPE
technology o
fund o
. o

Over o
three o
years o
, o
the o
fund o
has o
gone o
from o
taking o
losses o
to o
taking o
off o
; o
though o
it o
has o
levelled o
off o
somewhat o
lately o
, o
the o
returns o
have o
been o
excellent o
. o

Liu B-PER
declares o
himself o
to o
be o
" o
a o
faithful o
believer o
" o
in o
all o
manner o
of o
personal o
money o
management o
books o
, o
and o
when o
he o
has o
free o
time o
in o
summer o
vacation o
, o
he o
spends o
an o
average o
of o
20 o
hours o
a o
week o
looking o
at o
investment o
information o
. o

His o
greatest o
regret o
is o
that o
he o
began o
his o
financial o
career o
too o
late o
. o

He o
says o
: o
" o
If o
I o
had o
used o
my o
allowance o
every o
year o
from o
the o
time o
I o
was o
small o
to o
invest o
in o
a o
fund o
, o
at o
the o
rate o
of o
NT$ o
30,000 o
per o
year o
, o
after o
20 o
years o
, o
there o
would o
be o
quite o
a o
lot o
of o
money o
right o
now o
. o
" o

Becoming o
increasingly o
agitated o
, o
he o
adds o
that o
if o
he o
had o
understood o
money o
management o
early o
on o
, o
he o
could o
have o
invested o
right o
after o
the o
big o
stock o
market o
collapse o
in o
1990 o
, o
and o
he o
would o
be o
rich o
today o
instead o
of o
regretful o
. o

It o
looks o
like o
more o
and o
more o
of o
the o
e-generation o
are o
getting o
into o
investing o
. o

But o
do o
they o
know o
what o
they o
are o
doing o
? o

Dennis B-PER
Chien I-PER
of o
the o
money o
management o
website o
called o
JP B-ORG
Investment I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
strikes o
a o
cautionary o
note o
: o
" o
I o
do o
n't o
think o
the o
education o
system o
has o
fulfilled o
its o
responsibility o
to o
teach o
people o
how o
to o
manage o
their o
money o
. o
" o

Chien B-PER
points o
out o
that o
school o
textbooks o
only o
teach o
moral o
lessons o
like o
" o
a o
penny o
saved o
is o
a o
penny o
earned o
, o
" o
which o
are o
not o
exactly o
what o
the o
real o
world o
demands o
these o
days o
. o

In o
contrast o
, o
many o
American o
children o
understand o
a o
bit o
about o
money o
management o
from o
early o
on o
. o

For o
example o
, o
a o
child o
in o
her o
early o
teens o
might o
babysit o
for o
the o
neighbors o
or o
cut o
lawns o
, o
and o
then o
put o
the o
money o
in o
a o
mutual o
fund o
. o

Some o
investment o
websites o
have o
games o
for o
children o
to o
teach o
them o
about o
various o
investment o
instruments o
and o
portfolios o
. o

These o
treat o
personal o
money o
management o
as o
a o
serious o
life o
skill o
that o
all o
modern o
people o
should o
know o
. o

Chien B-PER
says o
that o
the o
situation o
is o
just o
like o
sex o
education o
in o
the o
past o
. o

They o
give o
it o
only o
the o
most o
cursory o
treatment o
in o
schools o
, o
but o
most o
people o
have o
a o
strong o
desire o
to o
find o
out o
about o
it o
, o
so o
as o
a o
result o
they o
have o
to o
pick o
up o
what o
they o
can o
from o
the o
newspapers o
or o
cable o
TV o
. o

The o
result o
of o
the o
lack o
of o
a o
proper o
investment o
outlook o
is o
that o
speculation o
is o
rampant o
. o

According o
to o
statistics o
of o
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, o
87.5 o
% o
of o
the o
trading o
volume o
on o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
stock o
exchange o
comes o
from o
individual o
investors o
. o

In o
1999 o
turnover o
was o
288 o
% o
-LRB- o
that o
is o
, o
total o
trading o
volume o
was o
2.88 o
times o
the o
total o
value o
of o
the o
market o
-RRB- o
, o
which o
, o
though o
considerably o
down o
from o
nearly o
600 o
% o
ten o
years o
before o
, o
remained o
four o
times o
higher o
than o
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
stock I-ORG
exchange I-ORG
. o

Despite o
numerous o
painful o
lessons o
in o
the o
past o
, o
the o
habit o
of o
chasing o
a o
rising o
market o
and o
cutthroat o
selling o
in o
a o
falling o
market o
has o
proven o
difficult o
to o
change o
. o

A o
new o
climate o
for o
the o
e-generation o

Fortunately o
, o
over o
the o
last o
three o
years o
foreign o
investors o
have o
brought o
some o
new o
ideas o
into o
the o
country o
. o

Although o
they o
still o
engage o
in o
" o
hit o
- o
and o
- o
run o
" o
high o
- o
volume o
trading o
for o
quick o
gains o
, o
at o
least o
most o
foreign o
investors o
ignore o
gossip o
and o
do o
n't o
touch o
the o
more o
speculative o
stocks o
. o

Rather o
, o
they o
put o
more o
emphasis o
on o
the o
fundamentals o
of o
a o
given o

notes o
that o
foreign o
firms o
have o
also o
introduced o
risk o
management o
ideas o
like o
" o
having o
a o
well o
- o
rounded o
portfolio o
" o
-LRB- o
i.e. o
" o
do o
n't o
put o
all o
your o
eggs o
in o
one o
basket o
" o
-RRB- o
. o

These o
have o
had o
a o
positive o
impact o
on o
the o
local o
stock o
market o
, o
and o
have o
given o
the o
investment o
activities o
of o
the o
e-generation o
a o
more o
rational o
foundation o
than o
those o
of o
their o
parents o
. o

The o
chief o
characteristics o
of o
the o
current o
wave o
of o
e-generation o
personal o
money o
management o
are o
great o
ambition o
, o
reliance o
on o
expert o
analysis o
, o
and o
diversification o
of o
investment o
targets o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
the o
hottest o
investments o
are o
always o
changing o
, o
and o
perhaps o
no o
amount o
of o
rational o
analysis o
or o
detailed o
information o
will o
be o
able o
to o
change o
this o

in o

has o
been o
observing o
the o
evolution o
of o
the o
financial o
environment o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o
many o
years o
, o
and o
offers o
the o
following o
thoughts o
about o
trends o
in o
money o
management o
. o

Chia B-PER
recalls o
that o
in o
the o
1960s o
, o
people o
were o
too o
poor o
to o
have o
any o
money o
to o
manage o
; o
there o
were o
also o
fears o
of o
war o
, o
and o
so o
any o
money o
people o
did o
have o
they o
quickly o
exchanged o
for o
gold o
or o
US B-GPE
dollars o
on o
the o
black o
market o
. o

In o
the o
1970s o
, o
faced o
with o
two o
oil o
crises o
and o
inflation o
, o
the o
idea o
of o
buying o
property o
to o
preserve o
value o
became o
widespread o
, o
and o
those o
who o
could o
afford o
it o
bought o
land o
and o
houses o
. o

At o
that o
time o
, o
the o
stock o
market o
had o
only o
a o
hundred o
or o
so o
listed o
companies o
, o
and o
its o
fate o
depended o
on o
a o
few o
manipulators o
behind o
the o
scenes o
. o

It o
was o
seen o
as o
a o
" o
cannibalistic o
market o
" o
which o
scared o
off o
most o
citizens o
. o

The o
past o
is o
gone o

The o
real o
fad o
for o
personal o
money o
management o
only o
hit o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
the o
mid-1980s o
. o

It o
was o
then o
that o
the o
country o
's o
accumulated o
economic o
resources o
began o
to o
come o
to o
the o
surface o
. o

The o
huge o
trade o
surplus o
built o
up o
over o
many o
years o
caused o
the o
NT o
dollar o
to o
appreciate o
, o
and o
attracted o
a o
huge o
amount o
of o
speculative o
foreign o
money o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

The o
stock o
market o
index o
rose o
from o
600 o
or o
so o
in o
1985 o
to o
more o
than o
12,000 o
by o
1990 o
. o

Meanwhile o
, o
the o
price o
of o
property o
rose o
from o
an o
average o
of o
NT$ o
71,800 o
per o
ping o
-LRB- o
about o
3.3 o
square o
meters o
-RRB- o
in o
1986 o
to o
NT$ o
284,500 o
per o
ping o
in o
1989 o
. o

At o
that o
time o
, o
great o
opportunities o
for o
making o
money o
stared o
one o
right o
in o
the o
face o
. o

In o
pursuit o
of o
overnight o
wealth o
, o
many o
people o
mortgaged o
their o
property o
to o
buy o
stocks o
, o
and o
then o
used o
their o
stocks o
as o
collateral o
to o
borrow o
more o
money o
, o
creating o
a o
vicious o
cycle o
that o
laid o
the o
foundation o
for o
the o
burst o
bubble o
and o
huge o
debts o
of o
later o
years o
. o

But o
, o
having o
reviewed o
the o
past o
, o
Chia B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
i I-PER
declares o
: o
" o
In o
money o
management o
, o
you o
can o
only o
look o
to o
the o
future o
; o
there o
's o
no o
point o
in o
regretting o
what o
's o
gone o
. o
" o

Indeed o
, o
in o
the o
era o
of o
the o
Internet o
, o
with o
everything o
moving o
much o
faster o
, o
investment o
indicators o
like o
product o
popularity o
and o
employment o
trends o
can o
change o
overnight o
. o

Those o
who o
can o
not o
see o
the o
trends o
or o
who o
can o
not o
react o
fast o
enough o
are o
doomed o
to o
be o
the o
losers o
in o
the o
wealth o
game o
. o

Take o
for o
example o
the o
case o
of o
Mrs. o
Chang B-PER
. o

Widowed o
at o
an o
early o
age o
, o
for o
over o
20 o
years o
she o
supported o
her o
family o
as o
an o
independent o
real o
estate o
broker o
. o

Her o
success o
made o
her o
very o
confident o
about o
her o
understanding o
of o
the o
property o
market o
. o

Six o
years o
ago o
, o
she o
decided o
to o
help o
the o
family o
of o
her o
younger o
brother o
, o
who o
contracted o
a o
terminal o
illness o
, o
to o
buy o
a o
new o
house o
. o

At o
the o
time o
, o
the o
price o
of o
high o
- o
rise o
apartments o
in o
the o
Tanshui o
New o
Town o
had o
fallen o
from o
NT$ o
220,000 o
per o
ping o
to o
NT$ o
150,000 o
. o

Congratulating o
herself o
on o
getting o
a o
low o
price o
, o
and o
confident o
that o
the o
market o
would o
rebound o
, o
Mrs. o
Chang B-PER
happily o
put o
down o
the o
first o
payment o
and o
watched o
her o
brother o
's o
family o
move o
in o
. o

However o
, o
it o
was o
about o
this o
time o
that o
many o
new o
projects o
- o
started o
earlier o
by o
construction o
firms o
hoping o
to o
take o
advantage o
of o
peak o
prices o
- o
came o
on o
the o
market o
. o

The o
number o
of o
empty o
units o
rose o
to o
over o
one o
million o
. o

Next o
, o
increased o
cross-strait o
tensions o
put o
a o
further o
damper o
on o
the o
property o
market o
. o

The o
September o
21 o
earthquake o
last o
year o
was o
the o
final o
straw o
. o

Today o
you o
can o
find o
high o
- o
rise o
apartments o
in o
Tanshui o
New o
Town o
for o
as o
little o
as o
NT$ o
110,000 o
per o
ping o
. o

Mrs. o
Chang B-PER
's o
brother o
's o
family o
is o
stuck o
with o
a o
heavy o
mortgage o
, o
and o
there o
are o
constant o
recriminations o
between o
Mrs. o
Chang B-PER
and o
her o
nieces o
and o
nephews. o

Will o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
property o
market o
inevitably o
recover o
? o

Not o
necessarily o
. o

Looking o
around o
the o
world o
, o
at o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
Japan B-GPE
, o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
, o
and o
even o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
there o
are o
countless o
examples o
of o
long o
- o
term o
downturns o
in o
the o
housing o
market o
. o

The o
popular o
book o
Die o
Broke o
notes o
that o
the o
sharp o
rise o
in o
housing o
prices o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
in o
the o
1960s o
and o
1970s o
was o
due o
to o
underlying o
structural o
factors o
: o

The o
large o
generation o
of o
" o
baby o
boomers o
" o
were o
starting o
careers o
and o
families o
, o
thereby o
increasing o
demand o
for o
housing o
. o

At o
that o
time o
, o
some o
of o
the o
older o
generation o
about o
to o
retire o
happily o
sold o
their o
houses o
to o
the o
younger o
at o
high o
prices o
. o

The o
large o
profits o
they o
earned o
attracted o
numerous o
speculators o
into o
the o
market o
, o
and o
prices o
were o
driven o
even o
higher o
, o
encouraging o
construction o
of o
ever o
more o
homes o
. o

But o
now o
that o
most o
of o
the o
baby o
boomers o
have o
their o
own o
homes o
, o
and o
the o
current o
" o
e-generation o
" o
is o
smaller o
, o
who o
are o
all o
those o
extra o
homes o
going o
to o
be o
sold o
to o
? o

Snafu o

The o
upshot o
of o
all o
this o
is o
, o
as o
Hsu B-PER
Yen I-PER
- I-PER
shan I-PER
, o
chairman o
of o
the B-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
at o
National B-ORG
Chengchi I-ORG
University I-ORG
, o
cautions o
: o
" o
There o
are o
no o
absolute o
experts o
at o
money o
management o
. o
" o

So o
- o
called o
experts o
are o
simply o
those o
who o
have o
particular o
knowledge o
about o
a o
certain o
sector o
in o
a o
certain o
place o
at o
a o
certain o
time o
. o

But o
you o
know o
the o
old o
saying o
: o
" o
People o
have o
two o
feet o
, o
but o
money o
has o
four o
. o
" o

Trends o
change o
faster o
than o
most o
people o
can o
anticipate o
. o

No o
wonder o
the o
" o
stock o
masters o
" o
featured o
on o
cable o
TV o
usually o
disappear o
from o
view o
after o
a o
brief o
reign o
, o
only o
to o
be o
replaced o
by o
equally o
short o
- o
lived o
successors o
. o

In o
the o
past o
two o
years o
, o
perhaps o
brainwashed o
by o
money o
management o
dogma o
that o
says o
" o
the o
early o
bird o
gets o
the o
worm o
, o
" o
investors o
have o
swarmed o
like o
bees o
for o
the o
latest o
fads o
, o
sometimes o
jumping o
in o
even o
before o
the o
true o
value o
is o
known o
. o

The o
US B-GPE
NASDAQ B-ORG
index o
, o
which o
has o
a o
history o
of o
29 o
years o
behind o
it o
, o
suddenly o
surged o
from o
2800 o
in o
October o
of o
last o
year o
to o
more o
than o
5000 o
by o
March o
of o
this o
year o
. o

Telecommunications o
, o
Internet o
, o
and o
biotechnology o
stocks o
soared o
. o

The o
price o
- o
to o
- o
earnings o
ratio o
of o
some o
individual o
stocks o
reached o
500 o
, o
which o
some o
ridiculed o
as o
the o
" o
price o
- o
to o
- o
dream o
ratio o
. o
" o

" o
Investors o
sometimes o
act o
as o
if o
they o
do o
n't o
care o
about o
a o
company o
's o
current o
losses o
, o
but o
simply o
put o
all o
their o
faith o
in o
the o
distant o
future o
. o

Unfortunately o
, o
the o
farther o
in o
the o
future o
something o
is o
, o
the o
more o
likely o
it o
is o
that o
expectations o
will o
be o
wrong o

Chiu B-PER
Shean I-PER
- I-PER
bii I-PER
, o
a o
professor o
of o
finance o
at o
National B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
University I-ORG
. o

Beginning o
in o
mid-March o
of o
this o
year o
, o
NASDAQ B-ORG
high o
- o
tech o
stocks o
plummeted o
. o

For o
many o
investors o
, o
earnings o
accumulated o
over o
many o
years o
disappeared o
in o
a o
matter o
of o
weeks o
. o

The o
misguided o
idea o
that o
" o
what o
is o
new o
is o
better o
" o
also o
has o
been o
a o
problem o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

A o
certain o
" o
Mr. o
Wang B-PER
, o
" o
who o
works o
in o
the o
government o
, o
last o
year o
thought o
he o
would o
jump o
on o
the o
bandwagon o
for o
telecom o
and o
Internet o
stocks o
. o

He o
borrowed o
money o
to o
purchase o
80 o
blocks o
of o
shares o
, o
at o
NT$ o
13 o
per o
share o
, o
of o
fixed o
- o
line o
Internet o
network o
stocks o
, o
which o
had o
n't o
yet o
even o
been o
listed o
. o

When o
the o
price o
fell o
to o
NT$ o
11 o
per o
share o
, o
he o
still o
did o
n't o
worry o
, o
thinking o
that o
" o
so o
long o
as o
I o
do o
n't o
sell o
, o
the o
loss o
wo o
n't o
be o
realized o
. o
" o

Little o
did o
he o
expect o
that o
the o
new o
government o
would o
clamp o
down o
on o
illegal o
trading o
in o
fixed o
- o
line o
network o
stocks o
. o

Suddenly o
his o
whole o
investment o
- o
well o
over o
NT$ o
1 o
million o
- o
has o
been o
frozen o
, o
and o
all o
he o
can o
do o
is o
stand o
on o
the o
sidelines o
in o
a o
state o
of o
panic o
. o

To o
be o
sure o
, o
ignorance o
of o
new o
trends o
is o
not o
recommended o
, o
but o
looking o
too o
far o
into o
the o
future o
can o
also o
lead o
to o
disappointment o
. o

Indeed o
, o
in o
this o
information o
era o
, o
money o
management o
may o
even o
be o
getting o
more o
difficult o
. o

Strange o
to o
say o
, o
but o
the o
explosion o
of o
money o
management o
information o
, o
which o
should o
in o
theory o
make o
investors o
' o
lives o
easier o
, o
does o
not o
. o

As o
Chiu B-PER
Shean I-PER
- I-PER
bii I-PER
says o
: o
" o
There o
's o
plenty o
of o
information o
out o
there o
, o
and o
there o
are o
so o
- o
called o
experts o
everywhere o
. o

But o
the o
result o
is o
that o
investors o
do o
n't o
know o
what o
to o
believe o
, o
and o
find o
it o
even o
more o
difficult o
to o
make o
a o
decision o
. o
" o

Moreover o
, o
often o
even o
the o
best o
information o
and o
analysis o
is o
no o
match o
for o
sheer o
luck o
. o

Chang I-PER
, o
editor o

in o
- o
chief o
of o
the o
money o
management o
website o
SmartNet B-ORG
, o
describes o
a o
case o
in o
point o
. o

Last o
year o
, o
one o
of o
the o
hottest o
stocks o
was o
Quanta B-ORG
Computers I-ORG
, o
which o
reached o
800 o
per o
share o
. o

The o
story o
goes o
that o
there o
was o
an o
old o
grandmother o
who o
followed o
the o
crowd o
in o
and o
out o
of o
the o
stock o
, o
earning o
a o
huge o
amount o
in o
the o
process o
. o

Afterwards o
, o
she o
asked o
: o
" o
What o
I o
still o
do o
n't o
understand o
is o
, o
how o
can o
selling o
pork o
jerky o
be o
so o
profitable o
? o
" o

It o
turns o
out o
that o
she o
thought o
she o
was o
investing o
in o
a o
dried o
- o
pork o
company o
of o
the o
same o
name o
, o
and o
those o
who o
heard o
her o
question o
nearly o
fainted o
with o
disbelief o
. o

Money o
management o
madness o

The o
fever o
for o
money o
management o
has o
in o
fact o
disrupted o
the o
lives o
of o
many o
people o
, o
and o
brought o
a o
lot o
of o
headaches o
. o

However o
, o
Jessica B-PER
Liu I-PER
, o
associate o
director o
of o
the o
Taipei B-GPE
branch o
of o
UBS B-ORG
, o
who o
has o
written o
a o
number o
of o
books o
on o
money o
management o
, o
says o
that o
there o
is o
no o
turning o
back o
. o

Whenever o
some o
people o
get o
ahead o
, o
others o
will o
follow o
, o
and o
no o
amount o
of o
calls o
for o
simpler o
lifestyles o
or o
new o
value o
systems o
can o
stop o
them o
. o

The o
reason o
is o
very o
simple o
. o

" o
The o
money o
management o
fever o
is o
a o
natural o
product o
of o
changing o
times o
. o
" o

According o
to o
Liu B-PER
, o
individualism o
and o
the o
rise o
of o
urban o
commercial o
society o
have o
broken o
down o
the o
support o
networks o
of o
traditional o
agricultural o
society o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
since o
the o
1980s o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
been o
swept o
up o
in o
the o
globalization o
of o
capitalism o
. o

Rural o
society o
has o
disintegrated o
, o
and o
traditional o
industrial o
sectors o
have o
withered o
, o
as o
newly o
rising o
electronics o
and o
information o
industries o
have o
appeared o
one o
after o
another o
. o

These o
rapid o
changes o
have o
brought o
the o
threat o
of o
unemployment o
or o
early o
retirement o
to o
many o
individuals o
. o

In o
order o
to o
cope o
with o
the o
increasing o
uncertainty o
of o
life o
, o
it o
is o
necessary o
for o
people o

Liu B-PER
says o
: o
" o
If o
you o
have o
NT$ o
30 o
million o
in o
the o
bank o
, o
you o
do o
n't o
care o
whether o
you o
have o
to o
retire o
or o
not o
. o

What o
's o
important o
is o
that o
you o
do o
n't o
have o
to o
worry o
about o
the o
future o
, o
and o
live o
in o
fear o
that o
a o
sudden o
loss o
of o
your o
salary o
could o
ruin o
your o
life o

" o
Of o
course o
, o
everyone o
feels o
a o
different o
sense o
of o
urgency o
about o
the o
uncertainties o
of o
life o

Sometimes o
, o
in o
fact o
, o
this o
can o
become o
a o
source o
of o
interpersonal o
friction o

" o
Miss o
Chen B-PER
" o
of o

worries o
that o
her o
father o
, o
soon o
to o
retire o
at o
age o
60 o
, o
does o
n't o
think o
much o
about o
money o
, o
and o
his o
expected o
retirement o
plus o
savings o
will o
be o
less o
than o
NT$ o
4 o
million o

about o
US$ o
120,000 o

You o

As o
Miss o
Chen B-PER
does o
not o
hesitate o
to o
say o
: o
" o
My o
Mom o
and o
Dad o
still o
think o
that o
it o
would o
only o
mean o
an o
extra o
set o
of o
chopsticks o
on o
the o
table o
for o
them o
to o
live o
with o
their o
daughter o
. o

It o
seems o
they o
have o
n't o
realized o
yet o
that o
they o
may o
live o
to o
be o
85 o
. o

They o
have o
n't o
made o
any o
preparations o
for o
living o
expenses o
, o

the o
enormous o
medical o
expenses o
that o
can o
be o
expected o
over o
the o
next o
25 o

She o
has o
encouraged o
her o
parents o
to o
put o
part o
of o
their o
savings o
into o
a o
mutual o

or o
the o
like o
, o

without o

Indeed o
, o
the o
issue o
has o
become o
a o
sore o
point o
between o
her o

her o

the o
changes o

A o

It o
's o

Chang B-PER
admits o
that o
he o
still o
lives o
in o
a o
rented o
house o
in o
Tanshui B-GPE
. o

His o
wife o
wonders o
why o
his o
colleagues o
in o
the o
financial o
management o
community o
are o
multi-millionaires o
, o
while o
he o
still o
has o
not o
had o
his o
rendezvous o
with o
fortune o
. o

Chang B-PER
tells o
his o
wife o
that o
one o
should o
not o
compare o
oneself o
to o
others o
. o

Their o
success o
may o
be o
temporary o
or o
even o
illusory o
. o

A o
number o
of o
his o
friends o
who o
had o
insider o
information o
were o
quite o
proud o
of o
themselves o
when o
they o
profited o
from o
the o
rise o
of o
Taiwan B-ORG
Pineapple I-ORG
to o
more o
than o
200 o
. o

But o
within o
less o
than o
two o
years o
, o
the o
stock o
collapsed o
and o
became o
worthless o
paper o
. o

Chang B-PER
recalls o
an o
inexperienced o
reporter o
who o
got o
sucked o
in o
to o
the o
market o
two o
years o
ago o
by o
some o
irresistible o
insider o
information o
. o

He o
even o
mortgaged o
his o
house o
and o
persuaded o
his o
friends o
to o
invest o
with o
him o
. o

Today o
, o
he o
still o
has o
not o
got o
his o
head o
above o
water o
. o

Chang B-PER
says o
, o
" o
The o
longer o
I o
'm o
in o
this o
business o
, o
the o
more o
I o
feel o
that o
you o
ca o
n't o
get o
anywhere o
by o
trying o
to o
get o
ahead o
quickly o
. o
" o

Investment o
options o
are o
like o
churning o

; o
of o
course o
you o
enjoy o
the o
ride o
as o
long o
as o
you o
are o
on o
top o
of o
the o
water o
, o
but o
currents o
shift o
, o
and o
eventually o
you o
may o
get o
sucked o
down o
. o

" o
In o
investing o
, o
until o
the o
final o
moment o
, o
you o
never o

whether o
you o
've o
won o

Jessica B-PER
Liu I-PER
, o
who o
personally o
feels o
little o
anxiety o
about o
money o
management o
, o
points o
out o
that o
one o
of o
her o
core o
principles o
for o
investing o
is o
to o
not o
compare o
herself o
with o
others o
. o

" o
This o
is o
because o
I o
know o
that o
opportunities o
to o
make o
money o
come o
and o
go o
. o

If o
I o
do o
n't o
make o
a o
lot o
this o
wave o
, o
there o
'll o
be o
another o
wave o
later o
. o
" o

She o
says o
that o
anxiety o
rises o
in o
direct o
proportion o
to o
a o
person o
's o
expectations o
and o
desires o
. o

The o
more o
you o
want o
, o
the o
more o
anxiety o
you o
feel o
, o
and o
the o
greater o
will o
be o
the o
sense o
of o
disappointment o
if o
you o
fail o
. o

In o
other o
words o
, o
anxiety o
derives o
from o
greed o
. o

" o
If o
you o
buy o
TSMC B-ORG
at o
150 o
hoping o
it o
will o
go o
up o
to o
220 o
within o
a o
couple o
of o
months o
because o
that o
's o
what o
you o
need o
to o
make o
your o
final o
house o
payment o
, o
then o
it o
only o
goes o
up o
to o
200 o
, o
you o
'll o
feel o
dissatisfied o
, o
" o
says o
Liu B-PER
. o

This o
sense o
of o
disappointment o
is o
completely o
due o
to o
the o
lack o
of o
a o
proper o
money o
management o
outlook o
. o

People o
in o
middle o
age o
invest o
in o
hopes o
of o
finding o
a o
sense o
of o
personal o
security o

But o
members o
of o
the o
e-generation o
often o
have o
more o
specific o
objectives o
in o

Last o

a o

finally o
borrowed o

the o

by o

he o

is o
not o

to o

Chen B-PER
Yi I-PER

fen I-PER
, o
who o
comes o
across o
all o
manner o
of o
money o
management o
plans o
every o
day o
, o
often o
wonders o
about o
the o
meaning o
of o
it o
all o
. o

She o
says o
that o
today o
banks o
are o
always o
talking o
about o
how o
they o
want o
to o
provide o
every o
individual o
with o
tools o
to o
" o
intelligently o
manage o
money o
. o
" o

For o
example o
, o
they o
provide o
credit o
cards o
that o
award o
bonus o
points o
, o
housing o
loans o
with o
built o
- o
in o
short o
- o
term o
overdrafts o
for o
investment o
, o
and o
even o
mutual o
fund o
accounts o
that o
will o
automatically o
invest o
a o
specific o
amount o
at o
fixed o
times o
. o

But o
how o
much o
money o
is o
enough o
? o

That o
depends o
on o
the o
values o
of o
the o
individual o
. o

" o
Each o
individual o
should o
choose o
a o
lifestyle o
and o
belief o
system o
that o
they o
feel o
comfortable o
with o
, o
and o
not o
just o
follow o
the o
crowd o
, o
" o
says o
Chen B-PER
. o

After o
all o
, o
in o
a o
pluralized o
society o
, o
there o
should o
be o
more o
than o
one o
definition o
of o
success o
. o

Recently o
there o
was o
a o
news o
story o
about o
the o
old o
author o
Chang B-PER
Tuo I-PER
- I-PER
wu I-PER
having o
to o
sell o
lottery o
tickets o
on o
the o
street o
. o

One o
financial o
expert o
took o
Chang B-PER
as o
an o
object o
lesson o
to o
" o
warn o
" o
people o
to o
learn o
how o
to o
manage o
their o
money o
. o

Yet o
, o
looking o
at o
this o
another o
way o
, o
if o
Chang B-PER
had o
spent o
his o
youth o
worrying o
about o
accumulating o
money o
, o
he o
would o
not o
have o
had o
the o
experiences o
he o
did o
and o
made o
his o
way o
from o
being o
an o
ordinary o
soldier o
to o
writing o
such o
moving o
works o
. o

In o
the o
end o
, o
there o
are o
no o
numbers o
that o
can o
validly o
measure o
what o
has o
been o
gained o
in o
life o
, o
and o
what o
lost o
. o

It o
is o
said o
that o
the o
two o
biggest o
causes o
of o
family o
arguments o
this o
year o
have o
been o
differences o
over o
who o
to o
vote o
for o
in o
the o
presidential o
election o
, o
and o
over o
what o
stocks o
to o
buy o
. o

As o
Jessica B-PER
Liu I-PER
reminds o
us o
, o
money o
management o
, o
like o
life o
itself o
, o
is o
an o
accumulation o
of o
small o
experiences o
, o
a o
long o
road o
with o
ups o
and o
downs o
, o
and o
so o
should o
be o
faced o
with o
equanimity o
. o

After o
all o
, o
is o
n't o
the o
point o
of o
making o
money o
to o
have o
a o
better o
life o
? o

But o
if o
you o
lose o
your o
sense o
of o
fun o
, o
your o
health o
, o
or o
your o
friends o
and o
family o
in o
the o
process o
, o
and o
if o
you o
win o
the o
money o
game o
only o
at o
the o
cost o
of o
losing o
the o
game o
of o
life o
, o
what o
kind o
of o
a o
return o
on o
your o
investment o
is o
that o
? o

Chen B-PER
, o
who o
used o
concrete o
actions o
to o

to o

that o
our o

Chen B-PER
's o
stopover o
in o
Los B-GPE
Angeles I-GPE
was o
a o
sensitive o
subject o
, o
for o
Chen B-PER
had o
originally o
planned o
an o
informal o
meeting o
with o
several o
members o
of o
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
. o

After o
furious o
protests o
from o
Beijing B-GPE
and o
discouragement o
from o
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
, o
however o
, o
Chen B-PER
canceled o
the o
plan o
just o
the o
day o
before o
arriving o
in o
Los B-GPE
Angeles I-GPE
. o

A o
crowd o
of o
500 o
to o
600 o
Taiwanese o
living o
in o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
showed o
up o
to o
greet o
the o
president o
at o
his o
hotel o
and o
protest o
against o
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
government I-ORG
's I-ORG
" o
caving o
in o
to o
Beijing B-GPE
at o
the o
expense o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE

" o

When o
Chen B-PER
arrived o
on o
the o
14th o
in o
the B-GPE
Dominican I-GPE
Republic I-GPE
, o
he o
was o
greeted o
at o
the o
airport o
by o
over o
100 o
representatives o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
business o
community o
there o
, o
and o
more o
than o
700 o
Taiwanese o
residents o
threw o
a o
party o
for o
the o
president o
that o
night o
at o
his o
hotel o
. o

The o
next o
day o
, o
Chen B-PER
took o
advantage o
of o
the o
upcoming o
presidential o
inauguration o
to o
meet o
with o
leaders o
from o
a o
number o
of o
countries o
with o
which o
the o
ROC B-GPE
has o
diplomatic o
relations o
, o
including o
the o
vice-president o
of o
El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
and o
the o
second o
vice o
president o
of o
Panama B-GPE
. o

On o
the o
16th o
Chen B-PER
attended o
the o
inauguration o
of o
President o
Hipolito B-PER
Mejia I-PER
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
contingent o
was o
larger o
than o
any o
other o
at o
the o
ceremony o
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
currently o
has o
diplomatic o
relations o
with o
29 o
countries o
, o
half o
of o
which o
are o
located o
in o
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
and o
the o
Caribbean B-LOC
. o

In o
recent o
years o
, o
however o
, o
mainland o
China B-GPE
has o
continually o
upgraded o
its o
trade o
links o
with o
the o
ROC B-GPE
's o
diplomatic o
partners o
. o

The o
allegiance o
of o
a o
number o
of o
these o
countries o
may o
be o
put o
to o
the o
test o
in o
the o
coming o
years o
by o
various o
political o
and o
economic o
considerations o
. o

In o
the o
case o
of o
the B-GPE
Dominican I-GPE
Republic I-GPE
, o
for o
example o
, o
supporters o
of o
President o
Mejia B-PER
announced o
to o
the o
media o
on o
the o
eve o
of o
President o
Chen B-PER
's o
arrival o
that o
mainland o
China B-GPE
was o
planning o
to o
build o
a o
large o
thermal o
power o
plant o
in o
their o
country o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
the B-GPE
Dominican I-GPE
Republic I-GPE
is o
seeking o
a o
seat o
on o
the B-ORG
UN I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
in o
2002 o
, o
and o
will o
certainly o
be o
lobbying o
for o
Beijing B-GPE
's o
support o
. o

This o
situation o
could o
affect o
relations o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

On o
the o
bright o
side o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
scored o
a o
few o
points o
of o
its o
own o
in o
this o
diplomatic o
tug o
of o
war o
. o

When o
Chen B-PER
arrived o
in o
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
on o
the o
18th o
, o
his o
hosts o
departed o
from o
the o
pattern o
of o
the o
past o
few o
years o
by o
promising o
to o
support o
the o
ROC B-GPE
s o
bid o
for o
membership o
in o
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. o

Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
's I-GPE
President o
Miguel B-PER
Rodriguez I-PER
also o
accompanied o
President o
Chen B-PER
on o
a o
tour o
of o
a o
Taiwanese o
export o
processing o
zone o
, o
an o
orchid o
farm o
run o
by o
Taiwan B-ORG
Sugar I-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
, o
and o
a o
vocational o
training o
school o
. o

President o
Chen B-PER
departed o
on o
the o
20th o
for o
Africa B-LOC
, o
where o
the o
ROC B-GPE
has o
eight o
diplomatic o
partners o
. o

Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
is o
the o
first o
ROC B-GPE
president o
ever o
to o
travel o
to o
western B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. o

There o
is o
little o
two o
- o
way o
trade o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
any o
of o
the o
three o
countries o
on o
Chen B-PER
's o
African o
itinerary o
. o

Instead o
, o
agricultural o
and o
economic o
assistance o
constitute o
the o
mainstays o
of o
our o
diplomatic o
ties o
with o
these o
countries o
. o

Taiwanese o
agricultural o
specialists o
stationed o
in o
Burkina B-GPE
Faso I-GPE
have o
converted o
1,000 o
hectares o
of o
desert o
to o
arable o
land o
, o
while o
Taiwanese o
specialists o
sent o
to o
Gambia B-GPE
have o
successfully o
transplanted o
tomatoes o
, o
green o
beans o
, o
okra o
, o
and o
various o
leafy o
vegetables o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
raised o
them o
on o
Gambian o
soil o
. o

In o
addition o
to o
this o
type o
of o
technical o
assistance o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
also o
assisted o
with o
various o
infrastructure o
projects o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
's o
most o
notable o
contribution o
to o
Gambia B-GPE
's o
infrastructure o
is o
the o
main o
terminal o
at o
the o
airport o
. o

Gambian o
President o
Yahya B-PER
Jameh I-PER
declared o
his o
support o
for o
admission o
of o
the o
ROC B-GPE
to o
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, o
and o
as o
a o
gesture o
of o
goodwill o
declared o
that o
all o
holders o
of o
ROC B-GPE
passports o
would o
henceforth o
automatically o
be o
granted o
90 o
- o
day o
landing o
visas o
upon o
arrival o
in o
Gambia B-GPE
. o

President o
Chen B-PER
's o
trip o
yielded o
many o
positive o
results o
and o
generated o
a o
lot o
of o
very o
favorable o
media o
coverage o
, o
but o
it o
was o
not o
problem o
- o
free o
. o

First o
, o
as o
the o
president o
was o
preparing o
to o
depart o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
the o
Nicaraguan o
foreign o
minister o
publicly o
called o
upon o
the o
ROC B-GPE
to o
make o
good o
on o
the o
previous o
administration o
's o
promise o
of o
US$ o
100 o
million o
in o
assistance o
. o

This o
remark o
sparked o
controversy o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
where o
some o
accused o
the o
new o
government o
of o
pursuing o
the o
same o
" o
checkbook o
diplomacy o
" o
practiced o
by o
its o
predecessor o
. o

Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
responded o
that o
while o
the o
new o
administration o
has o
not o
made o
plans o
for o
any o
new o
promises o
of o
foreign o
aid o
, o
neither o
will o
it o
fail o
to o
honor o
the o
promises o
made o
by o
its o
predecessor o
. o

Foreign o
Minister o
Tien B-PER
Hung I-PER
- I-PER
mao I-PER
stated o
that o
the o
purpose o
of o
Chen B-PER
's o
trip o
was o
to o
consolidate o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
diplomatic o
ties o
, o
and o
to o
strengthen o
friendships o
by o
building o
upon o
the o
existing o
foundation o
. o

Tien B-PER
stressed o
that o
the o
president o
would o
not o
sign o
any o
new o
foreign o
aid o
agreements o
. o

President o
Chen B-PER
received o
a o
very o
warm o
welcome o
in o
Nicaragua B-GPE
, o
but o
the o
local o
press o
still o
mentioned o
" o
checkbook o
diplomacy o
" o
in o
reporting o
on o
the o
visit o
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
's o
ambassador o
to o
Nicaragua B-GPE
, o
Antonio B-PER
Tsai I-PER
, o
bluntly o
argued o
in o
a o
briefing o
with o
Chen B-PER
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
foreign o
assistance o
to o
Nicaragua B-GPE
was o
being o
misused o
. o

According o
to o
Tsai B-PER
, o
the o
assistance o
has o
been o
used o
to o
build o
a o
presidential o
palace o
and o
a o
new o
headquarters o
for o
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
. o

Opposition o
politicians o
charge o
that o
the o
aid o
has o
done o
nothing o
for o
everyday o
people o
, o
and o
Western o
nations o
have o
also o
been o
critical o
. o

A o
second o
problem o
connected o
with o
the o
trip o
was o
the o
question o
of o
who o
would o
act o
in o
the o
president o
's o
stead o
while o
he o
was o
out o
of o
the o
country o
. o

Concern o
over o
this o
issue o
prompted o
President o
Chen B-PER
to o
state o
before o
his o
departure o
that o
he o
would o
remain o
commander o
- o
in o
- o
chief o
of o
the o
military o
forces o
, o
and o
that o
he o
would o
maintain o
hot o
lines o
to o
every o
cabinet o
- o
level o
agency o
. o

The o
president o
said o
that o
there o
was o
no o
need o
for o
an o
acting o
president o
because o
he o
had o
taken o
painstaking o
precautions o
to o
ensure o
domestic o
political o
stability o
during o
his o
absence o
. o

So o
is o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
diplomacy o
a o
way o
of o
giving o
back o
to o
the o
international o
community o
? o

Or o
is o
it o
checkbook o
diplomacy o
? o

Ambassador o
- o
without o
- o
portfolio o
Lu B-PER
Yi I-PER
- I-PER
cheng I-PER
wrote o
an o
article o
in o
which o
he o
argued o
that o
foreign o
aid o
has o
always o
been o
universally o
recognized o
as o
a o
regular o
tool o
of o
diplomacy o
as o
well o
as o
a o
humanitarian o
necessity o
, o
and o
there o
is o
no o
reason o
why o
Taiwan B-GPE
should o
have o
to o
steer o
clear o
of o
it o
. o

He o
pointed o
out o
that o
the o
world o
's o
developed o
nations o
spend o
an o
average o
of o
0.24 o
% o
of o
GNP o
on o
foreign o
aid o
, o
as o
opposed o
to o
0.17 o
% o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
case o
. o

In o
view o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
economic o
strength o
, o
argued o
Lu B-PER
, o
our o
foreign o
aid o
expenditures o
need o
not o
be o
reduced o
; o
in o
fact o
, o
they o
should o
even o
be o
raised o
somewhat o
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
has o
been o
criticized o
a o
lot o
in o
recent o
years o
for o
pursuing o
checkbook o
diplomacy o
, o
so o
there o
was o
no o
surprise o
when o
this o
issue o
cropped o
up o
in o
connection o
with o
the o
president o
's o
trip o
. o

The o
question o
of o
an o
acting o
president o
, o
however o
, o
has o
never o
before o
been o
a o
matter o
of o
concern o
. o

This o
situation o
is o
to o
some o
degree o
a o
reflection o
of o
the o

She o

's o
political o
opposition o

very o
early o
in o
her o
career o
, o
and o
for o
a o
time o
chaired o
the B-ORG

After o
the o
DPP B-ORG
gained o
control o
of o
the o
central o
government o
, o
in o
view o
of o
Yang B-PER
's o
long o
overseas o
experience o
of o
diplomatic o
affairs o
and o
the o
overseas o
Chinese o
community o
, o
she o
was o
recruited o
into o

to o

over o
the o
important o
position o
of o
vice o
chair o
of o
the o
MOFA B-ORG
's o
Research B-ORG
and I-ORG

Board I-ORG
. o

In o
late o
August o
2000 o
, o
Maysing B-PER
Yang I-PER
and o
presidential o
advisor o
and o
former o
DPP B-ORG
chairman o
Peng B-PER
Ming I-PER
- I-PER
min I-PER
led o
a o
delegation o
to o
attend o
the o
53rd o
Annual o
DPI o
/ o
NGO o
Conference o
of o
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Information I-ORG
. o

She o
became o
the o
first o
serving o
MOFA B-ORG
official o
to o
enter o
the o
UN B-ORG
headquarters o
building o
since o
the o
ROC B-GPE
left o
the o
UN B-ORG
. o

When o
news o
of o
this o
got o
out o
, o
the o
PRC B-GPE
delegation o
at o
the o
UN B-ORG
immediately o
pro-tested o
, o
and o
demanded o
that o
the o
two o
should o
leave o
the o
conference o
chamber o
and o
be o
excluded o
from o
the o
UN B-ORG
building o
. o

The o
next o
day o
, o
showing o
commendable o
courage o
, o
Yang B-PER
and o
Peng B-PER
slipped o
back o
into o
the o
conference o
chamber o
. o

But o
their o
actions o
also o
attracted o
the o
criticism o
that o
this o
kind o
of o
high o
- o
decibel o
display o
is o
not o
in o
fact o
helpful o
for o
achieving o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
return o
to o
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. o

However o
, o
Yang B-PER
does o
not o
subscribe o
to o
this o
view o
. o

Enthusiastic o
, o
outspoken o
and o
full o
of o
vitality o
, o
she o
is o
highly o
optimistic o
about o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
prospects o
for o
participation o
in o
UN B-ORG
- o
associated o
NGOs o
, o
and o
believes o
that o
as o
temples o
of o
popular o
campaigning o
, o
NGOs o
can o
develop o
the o
strength o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
people o
. o

Below o
she o
describes o
her o
views o
. o

After o
the o
new o
government o
took o
office o
, o
apart o
from o
being o
briefed o
on o
our o
diplomatic o
partners o
and o
on o
countries o
with o
which o
we o
do o
n't o
have o
diplomatic o
relations o
, o
I o
also o
looked o
at o
civic o
organizations o
with o
which o
the o
MOFA B-ORG
has o
contacts o
and o
which o
are o
frequently o
active o
in o
the o
international o
community o
. o

I o
discovered o
that o
the B-ORG
World I-ORG
League I-ORG
for I-ORG
Freedom I-ORG
and I-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
is o
a o
well o
- o
run o
international o
organization o
with o
a o
complete o
organizational o
structure o
, o
is o
a o
member o
of o
the o
UN B-ORG
's o
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Information I-ORG
, o
and o
attends o
the o
Annual o
DPI o
/ o
NGO o
Conference o
every o
year o
. o

This o
year o
too o
it o
was o
planning o
to o
attend o
the o
millennium o
edition o
of o
the o
conference o
. o

Therefore o
when o
Professor o
Peng B-PER
invited o
me o
to o
attend o
, o
I o
agreed o
to o
join o
the o
delegation o
as o
an o
advisor o
to o
the o
league o
. o

The o
MOFA B-ORG
was o
very o
excited o
about o
my o
attending o
the o
conference o
, o
because o
we o
can o
say o
that o
this o
is o
the o
first o
time o
a o
MOFA B-ORG
official o
has o
entered o
the o
UN B-ORG
headquarters o
building o
in o
the o
last o
30 o
years o
. o

Everyone o
thought o
it o
was o
a o
great o
breakthrough o
. o

I o
also o
took o
the o
opportunity o
to o
personally o
get o
an o
understanding o
of o
how o
the o
DPI o
/ o
NGO o
Conference o
works o
, o
and o
of o
the o
direction o
of o
mainstream o
international o
thinking o
, o
and o
I o
collected o
a o
lot o
of o
relevant o
information o
in o
the o
form o
of o
conference o
materials o
. o

Thus o
we o
gained o
a o
great o
deal o
from o
attending o
. o

One o
of o
the o
main o
topics o
at o
this o
year o
's o
conference o
was o
the o
issue o
of o
how o
to o
go o
about o
monitoring o
how o
governments o
put o
into o
action o
their o
ideals o
and o
their o
promises o
to o
their o
peoples o
. o

Another o
main o
focus o
of o
discussion o
was o
the o
partnership o
between o
NGOs o
, o
national o
governments o
and o
the o
UN B-ORG
itself o
. o

These o
are o
all o
very o
important o
things o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
be o
thinking o
about o
, o
so o
we o
ought o
to o
participate o
more o
. o

The o
UN B-ORG
itself o
is o
an o
organization o
of o
national o
governments o
. o

At o
present o
we o
are o
excluded o
, o
and o
that o
is o
very o
difficult o
to o
change o
. o

NGOs o
represent o
a o
very o
good o
point o
of o
access o
. o

Today o
there o
are o
a o
tremendous o
number o
of o
NGOs o
. o

They o
hold o
frequent o
conferences o
, o
and o
they o
have o
an o
ever o
- o
growing o
influence o
on o
governments o
. o

For o
example o
, o
a o
couple o
of o
months o
ago o
I o
went o
to o
Warsaw B-GPE
to o
attend o
the o
International o
Forum o
on o
Democracy o
. o

The o
forum o
was o
attended o
by o
foreign o
ministers o
from o
over o
100 o
countries o
, o
but o
it o
was o
also o
an o
NGO o
conference o
. o

Those o
attending o
included o
the o
great o
American o
entrepreneur o
George B-PER
Soros I-PER
, o
who o
funded o
the o
forum o
, o
the o
former o
US B-GPE
ambassador o
to o
Beijing B-GPE
, o
Winston B-PER
Lord I-PER
, o
and o
so o
on o
- o
all o
high o
- o
ranking o
, o
highly o
influential o
people o
. o

In o
other o
words o
, o
NGOs o
are o
very o
broad o
church o
. o

Retired o
diplomats o
, o
business o
- o
people o
, o
social o
campaigners o
, o
academics o
and o
all o
kinds o
of o
foundations o
may o
be o
involved o
in o
NGOs o
. o

NGOs o
can o
be o
more o
powerful o
than o
governments o
, o
so o
governments o
certainly o
ca o
n o
t o
afford o
to o
ignore o
them o
. o

At o
present o
, o
apart o
from o
the B-ORG
World I-ORG
League I-ORG
for I-ORG
Freedom I-ORG
and I-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
, o
a o
number o
of o
other o
NGOs o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
associated o
with o
the o
UN B-ORG
, o
including o
women o
's o
, o
aboriginal o
and o
academic o
groups o
. o

We o
hope o
that o
in o
the o
future o
more o
groups o
will o
actively o
develop o
an o
international o
profile o
, o
and o
apply o
to o
register o
with o
the o
UN B-ORG
. o

Another o
way o
people o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
can o
actively o
participate o
in o
international o
affairs o
is o
by o
encouraging o
people o
of o
ability o
and o
influence o
in o
society o
to o
apply o
to o
join o
the o
UN B-ORG
's o
own o
NGOs o
, o
such o
as o
population o
, o
human o
rights o
, o
peace o
and o
environmental o
groups o
, o
so o
that o
they o
can o
contribute o
their o
knowledge o
, o
and o
at o
the o
same o
time o
let o
others o
better o
understand o
people o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

We o
are o
living o
in o
an o
age o
of o
people o
power o
, o
and o
the o
UN B-ORG
is o
responding o
to o
the o
trends o
of o
our o
time o
. o

In o
the o
past o
, o
NGOs o
merely o
played o
a o
monitoring o
role o
at o
the o
UN B-ORG
, o
but o
now o
the o
trend o
is o
towards o
their o
involvement o
in o
policy o
implementation o
. o

Hence o
in o
our o
future o
approach o
to o
the o
UN B-ORG
, o
besides o
continuing o
to o
press o
for o
admission o
by o
mobilizing o
our o
diplomatic o
partners o
to o
speak o
on o
our o
behalf o
, o
we o
should o
also o
actively o
seek o
to o
make o
the o
most o
of o
the o
power o
of o
our o
people o
. o

In o
particular o
, o
in o
the o
age o
of o
the o
Internet o
, o
universal o
values o
such o
as o
humanitarianism o
and o
human o
rights o
transcend o
the o
narrow o
confines o
of o
national o
boundaries o
and o
nationalism o
. o

The o
Taiwan B-GPE
issue o
is o
one o
of o
basic o
human o
rights o
. o

In o
other o
words o
, o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
being o
denied o
the o
right o
to o
speak o
and o
vote o
in o
international o
affairs o
. o

We o
can o
use o
the o
Internet o
to o
gain o
the o
support o
of o
international o
champions o
of o
justice o
. o

Furthermore o
, o
among o
Taiwanese o
compatriots o
living o
overseas o
there o
are o
many o
who o
opposed o
the o
old o
government o
, o
but o
are o
willing o
to o
support o
the o
new o
. o

These o
people o
are o
excellent o
partners o
through o
whom o
we o
can o
participate o
in o
UN B-ORG
NGOs o
. o

We o
should o
n't o
be o
afraid o
of o
the o
Chinese o
communist o
regime o
's o
attempts o
to o
suppress o
such o
activity o

. o

They o
wo o
n't o
last o
forever o
, o
and o
they o
ca o
n't o
discourage o
everyone o
who o
supports o
us o
. o

Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
Visits o
Taiwan B-GPE

Senior o
Minister o
Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
of o
Singapore B-GPE
came o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
on o
September o
23 o
, o
and o
though o
he o
did o
not o
publicly o
comment o
on o
the o
purpose o
of o
his o
visit o
, o
observers o
everywhere o
speculated o
that o
he o
may o
have o
come o
as o
an o
intermediary o
between o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
Beijing B-GPE
. o

Indeed o
, o
Lee B-PER
, o
who o
has o
been o
dubbed o
" o
the o
Asian o
Godfather o
, o
" o
played o
a o
key o
role o
in o
the o
early o
1990s o
in o
bringing o
about o
the o
first o
round o
of o
talks o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
Koo B-PER
Chen I-PER
- I-PER
fu I-PER
and o
Beijing B-GPE
's o
Wang B-PER
Daohan I-PER
. o

It o
remains o
to o
be o
seen o
whether o
Lee B-PER
's o
visit o
will o
bring o
any o
change o
in o
sensitive o
cross-strait o
relations o
, o
but o
President o

Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
revealed o
after o
Lee B-PER
's o
departure o
that o
he o
and o
his o
guest o
had o
reached o
three o
points o
of o
consensus o
, o
including o
the o
need o
for o
a o
Singapore B-GPE
- o
Taiwan B-GPE
free o
- o
trade o
zone o
. o

Lee B-PER
's o
four o
- o
day o
series o
of o
closed o
- o
door o
meetings o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
came o
to o
an o
end o
on o
September o
26 o
. o

He o
met o
twice o
with o

and o
had o
numerous o

with o

Although o
no o
one o
is o
saying o
so o
, o
it o
seems o
clear o
that o
Lee B-PER
's o
visit o
focused o
primarily o
on o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o

As o
one o
of o
the o
most o
senior o
politicians o
in o
the o
Asian o
region o
, o
and o
a o
man o
who o
has o
had o
close o
ties o
with o
several o
generations o
of o
leaders o
on o
both o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, o
Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
maintains o
a o
special o
status o
in o
both o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

The o
news o
media o
have o
even o
taken o
to o
calling o
him o
a o
cross-strait o
mediator o
. o

Lee B-PER
said o
that o
the o
purpose o
of o
his o
whirlwind o
visit o
was o
only o
to o
get o
a o
first o
- o
hand o
feel o
for o
the o
new o
administration o
. o

" o
I o
was o
never o
a o
cross-strait o
mediator o
, o
" o
he o
stated o
categorically o
, o
" o
and o
I o
've o
never o
said o
that o
I o
was o
. o
" o

MAC B-ORG
Vice o
Chairman o
Chen B-PER
Ming I-PER
- I-PER
tung I-PER
sounded o
a o
similar o
note o
during o
interpellations o
at o
the o
legislature o
. o

When o
asked o
whether o
Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
had o
come o
as o
Beijing B-GPE
's o
emissary o
, o
Chen B-PER
said o
, o
" o
I o
can o
guarantee o
that o
he o
has o
not o
. o
" o

Tsai B-PER
Ing I-PER
- I-PER
wen I-PER
, o
who o
met o
twice o
with o
Lee B-PER
during o
his o
brief o
stay o
, o
added o
that o
Lee B-PER
has o
considerable o
political o
stature o
in o
Asia B-LOC
and o
around o
the o
world o
, o
and o
his o
concern o
about o
cross-strait o
relations o
and o
the o
direction o
of o
policy o
in o
this o
regard o
is o
helpful o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Beijing B-GPE
has o
also o
commented o
favorably o
on o
Lee B-GPE
's o
visit o
. o

PRC B-GPE
Foreign B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
spokesman o
Sun B-PER
Yuxi I-PER
stated o
that o
while o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
issue o
is o
China B-GPE
's o
internal o
matter o
, o
it o
welcomes o
efforts o
by o
anyone o
who o
upholds o
the o
" o
one o
China B-GPE
" o
principle o
to o
bring o
about o
an o
early o
resolution o
. o

It o
would o
thus o
appear o
that o
Lee B-PER
's o
visit o
was o
welcomed o
by o
leaders o
on o
both o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, o
but o
in o
fact o
the o
two o
sides o
did o
not o
actually o
share o
a o
common o
view o
on o
the o
matter o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
's o
top o
concern o
was o
peace o
and o
stability o
, o
while o
mainland o
China B-GPE
continually o
brought o
up o
the o
theme o
of o
unification o
. o

Although o
Lee B-PER
's o
trip o
would o
seem o
to o
have o
been o
a o
shot o
in o
the o
arm o
for o
the o
deadlocked o
cross-strait o
relationship o
, o
it o
also o
generated o
a o
lot o
of o
speculation o
and o
ill o
will o
because o
neither o
Lee B-PER
nor o
anyone o
who o
met o
with o
him o
was o
willing o
to o
say o
a o
word o

Lee B-PER
's o
stay o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
certainly o
left o
the o
ROC B-GPE
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
-LRB- o
MOFA B-ORG
-RRB- o
with o
a o
bad o
taste o
in o
its o
mouth o
, o
for o
the o
MOFA B-ORG
was o
not o
involved o
in o
the o
visit o
in o
any o
way o
, o
and o
was o
n't o
even o
aware o
in o
advance o
that o
it o
was o
in o
the o
works o
. o

That o
seemed o
quite o
odd o
, o
considering o
that o
Lee B-PER
is o
the o
founding o
father o
of o
Singapore B-GPE
and o
is o
still o
active o
as o
Senior o
Minister o
. o

Many o
commentators o
blasted o
the o
way o
the o
visit o
was o
handled o
, o
and o
legislators o
described o
the o
affair o
as o
a o
serious o
breach o
of o
protocol o
. o

Foreign o
Minister o
Tien B-PER
Hung I-PER
- I-PER
mao I-PER
was o
quoted o
as o
saying o
, o
" o
I o
feel o
a o
bit o
kicked o
around o
. o
" o

President o
Chen B-PER
broke o
the o
silence o
after o
Lee B-PER
left o
, o
stating o
at o
a o
function o
in o
honor o
of o
model o
public o
servants o
that o
he o
and o
Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
had o
reached o
three o
agreements o
, o
namely o
that o
Singapore B-GPE
and o
Taiwan B-GPE
should o
: o
-LRB- o
1 o
-RRB- o
sign o
a o
" o
Singapore o
- o
Taiwan o
Free o
Trade o
Zone o
Agreement o
" o
; o
-LRB- o
2 o
-RRB- o
lend o
impetus o
to o
financial o
cooperation o
, o
especially o
a o
possible o
exchange o
rate o
agreement o
; o
and o
-LRB- o
3 o
-RRB- o
effect o
telecommunication o
and o
Internet o
alliances o
. o

President o
Chen B-PER
further o
stated o
that o
after o
Taiwan B-GPE
joins o
the B-ORG
World I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
-LRB- o
WTO B-ORG
-RRB- o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
Singapore B-GPE
, o
as o
fellow o
members o
of o
that o
select o
group o
of o
economic o
overachievers o
that o
journalists o
have o
come o
to o
dub o
" o
the o
Four o
Tigers o
, o
" o
should o
stop o
viewing o
each o
other o
as o
competitors o
and o
move o
toward o
a o
friendly o
division o
of o
labor o
. o

President o
Chen B-PER
also o
stressed o
: o
" o
Senior o
Minister o
Lee B-PER
is o
not o
a o
mediator o
. o

He o
is o
not o
pushing o
any o
particular o
viewpoint o
, o
and o
he o
is o
no o
one o
's o
mouthpiece o
. o
" o

Cross-strait o
relations o
, o
said o
Chen B-PER
, o
were o
just o
one o
of o
many o
issues o
that o
he o
discussed o
with o
Lee B-PER
. o

It o
may o
be o
that o
the o
pursuit o
of o
economic o
and o
trade o
relations o
is o
the o
only o
way o
to o
get o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
onto o
the o
path o
toward o
a o
resolution o
of o
the o
cross-strait o
stalemate o
. o

Separate o
entry o
into o
the o
WTO B-ORG
by o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
may o
be o
the o
best o
opportunity o
for o
the o
two o
sides o
to o
settle o
upon o
a o
" o
no o
unification o
, o
no o
independence o
" o
modus o
vivendi o
. o

It o
seems o
apparent o
that o
mainland o
China B-GPE
is o
the o
only o
place o
where o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
traditional o
industries o
can o
survive o
. o

Even o
high o
- o
tech o
industries o
are o
slowly o
making o
their o
way o
to o
the o
PRC B-GPE
. o

Uncertainty o
in o
cross-strait o
relations o
will o
inevitably o
hurt o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
economy o
. o

Lee B-PER
Kuan I-PER
Yew I-PER
describes o
the o
debate o
between o
" o
one o
China B-GPE
" o
versus o
" o
one o
China B-GPE
as o
a o
point o
for o
discussion o
" o
and o
other o
such o
issues o
as o
mere o
semantics o
, o
and o
says o
that o
only o
history o
can o
bring o
the o
cross-strait o
issue o
to o
a o
resolution o
. o

In o
the o
second o
half o
of o
his o
memoirs o
, o
which o
were o
published o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
September o
, o
Lee B-PER
writes o
: o
" o
Chinese o
people o
on o
both o
sides o
of o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
can o
reduce o
friction o
by o
building o
a o
relationship o
that o
is o
a o
bit o
more o
acceptable o
to o
both o
sides o
. o
" o

We o
ought o
to o
use o
Lee B-PER
's o
visit o
as o
an o
opportunity o
to o
take o
stock o
of o
our o
current o
situation o
and o
further o
clarify o
our o
policy o
vis o
- o
a o
- o
vis o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
thereby o
bringing o
about o
an o
improvement o
in o
cross-strait o
relations o
. o

Therein o
lies o
the o
most o
concrete o
significance o
of o
Lee B-PER
's o
trip o
. o

Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
: I-GPE

Sweating o
in o
the o
Spotlight o

Recently o
the o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Urban I-ORG
Development I-ORG
announced o
their o
idea o
for o
a o
" o
Taipei o
Citizen o
's o
Passport o
. o
" o

Who o
is o
their o
idea o
of o
a o
typical o
Taipei B-GPE
Citizen o
? o

The o
answer o
is o
an o
environmentally o
conscious o
, o
culture o
- o
loving o
person o
who o
has o
a o
soft o
spot o
in o
their o
heart o
for o
good o
causes o
- o
someone o
who o
reads o
several o
books o
a o
month o
, o
recycles o
, o
takes o
mass o
transit o
, o
donates o
blood o
, o
does o
volunteer o
work o
, o
plants o
flowers o
on o
their o
balcony o
and o
cleans o
their o
building o
's o
exterior o
walls o
. o

That o
's o
who o
! o

This o
" o
passport o
, o
" o
with o
its o
middle o
- o
class o
and o
decidedly o
Western B-LOC
sensibility o
, o
is o
just o
one o
example o
of o
how o
Taipei B-GPE
differs o
from o
other o
places o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Not o
long o
after o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
ascended o
to o
the o
ROC B-GPE
presidency o
, o
the B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
President I-ORG
began o
to o
come o
into o
sharp o
conflict o
with o
Taipei o
City o
Hall o
. o

They o
clashed o
over o
whether o
to o
build o
a o
domed o
stadium o
, o
over o
how o
to o
allocate o
government o
funds o
, o
over o
which o
romanization o
system o
should o
be o
employed o
to o
transcribe o
Chinese o
characters o
, o
and o
even o
over o
whether o
the o
mayor o
was o
showing o
the o
president o
proper o
respect o
. o

These o
conflicts o
have o
caused o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
to o
become o
isolated o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
other o
cities o
and o
counties o
. o

What o
exactly o
is o
at o
the o
heart o
of o
these o
disputes o
? o

Is o
there o
a o
north o
- o
south o
divide o
between o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
the o
other o
counties o
and o
cities o
? o

And o
are o
the o
calls o
of o
" o
Taipei B-GPE
first o
" o
and o
of o
" o
Taiwan B-GPE
first o
" o
mutually o
reinforcing o
or o
mutually o
exclusive o
? o

Taipei B-GPE
's o
wealth o
and o
high o
status o
as o
the o
capital o
have o
long o
been o
a o
sore o
spot o
with o
many o
people o
living o
elsewhere o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Some o
argue o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
ought o
to o
be o
divided o
into o
four o
counties o
by o
the B-LOC
Chuoshui I-LOC
River I-LOC
and o
the B-LOC
Central I-LOC
Mountain I-LOC
Range I-LOC
, o
with o
financial o
resources o
being o
equitably o
divided o
to o
create o
uniform o
levels o
of o
development o
in o
each o
. o

Others o
question o
whether o
the o
central o
government o
should o
be o
located o
at o
the o
northern o
tip o
of o
the o
island o
, o
making o
it o
difficult o
to o
reach o
for o
civil o
servants o
and o
regular o
citizens o
alike o
. o

Why o
not o
instead o
move o
the o
capital o
to o
Taichung B-GPE
, o
they o
suggest o
. o

Since o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
provincial o
government o
was o
largely o
disbanded o
two o
years o
ago o
, o
the o
21 o
counties o
and o
cities o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
been o
directly o
under o
the o
ROC B-GPE
central o
government o
. o

With o
the o
election o
of o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
, o
the o
ROC B-GPE
is o
now o
under o
the o
control o
of o
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Progressive I-ORG
Party I-ORG
-LRB- o
DPP B-ORG
-RRB- o
, o
as o
are o
many o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
other o
cities o
and o
counties o
, o
including o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
, o
which o
like o
Taipei B-GPE
enjoys o
special o
status o
as o
a o
" o
self o
- o
governing o
municipality o
. o
" o

Whereas o
the o
south o
was o
Chen B-PER
's o
principal o
source o
of o
votes o
, o
the o
blue o
of o
the o
KMT B-ORG
holds o
sway o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
, o
making o
the o
city o
a o
thorn o
in o
the o
side o
of o
the o
ruling o
DPP B-ORG
and o
threatening o
its o
privileged o
position o
. o

In o
July o
the o
city o
and o
the o
central o
government o
quarreled o
over o
how o
much o
money o
the o
city o
would o
be o
allotted o
in o
the o
national o
budget o
, o
and o
the o
city o
's o
share o
was o
cut o
by o
NT$ o
6 o
billion o
. o

Then o
in o
October o
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
lowered o
the o
population o
requirement o
for o
self o
- o
governing o
status o
, o
and o
Taichung B-GPE
City I-GPE
joined o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
as o
a o
special o
self o
- o
administered o
municipality o
. o

Various o
other o
large o
cities o
and o
counties o
also o
hope o
to o
achieve o
this o
so o
as o
to o
enjoy o
the o
same o
status o
as o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

The o
goose o
that o
lays o
the o
golden o
eggs o

Is o
Taipei B-GPE
really o
specially o
blessed o
? o

Why o
is o
it o
the o
focus o
of o
so o
much o
attention o
, o
of o
so o
much o
envy o
and o
jealousy o
? o

Perhaps o
the o
following o
figures o
can o
help o
shed o
some o
light o
on o
this o
matter o
: o

The B-LOC
Taipei I-LOC
Basin I-LOC
holds o
12 o
% o
of o
the o
island o
's o
population o
on o
only o
0.8 o
% o
of o
its o
land o
, o
yet o
it o
has o
one o
- o
sixth o
of o
the o
nation o
's o
high o
schools o
, o
one o
- o
third o
of o
its o
universities o
, o
and o
54 o
% o
of o
its o
cultural o
activities o
. o

At o
least o
75 o
% o
of o
all o
medium o
and o
large o
international o
conferences o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
held o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

More o
than o
90 o
% o
of o
multinationals o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
their o
headquarters o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

And o
among o
the o
100 o
largest o
domestic o
companies o
, o
more o
than o
70 o
are o
registered o
in o
the o
city o
and o
pay o
their o
business o
taxes o
there o
. o

Of o
the o
remaining o
, o
10 o
can o
be o
found o
in o
the o
Hsinchu o
Science o
Park o
. o

Whereas o
numerous o
factories o
are o
spread o
throughout o
central o
and o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
most o
are o
just o
producing o
for o
somewhere o
else o
. o

For o
these o
areas o
, o
a o
Taiwanese o
expression o
captures o
the o
situation o
pretty o
well o
: o

" o
The o
hens o
produce o
droppings o
but o
lay o
no o
eggs o
. o
" o

As o
far o
as o
the o
distribution o
of o
government o
largess o
is o
concerned o
, o
in o
1998 o
government o
expenditures o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
ran o
to o
about o
NT$ o
176 o
billion o
- o

that o
's o
three o
times o
more o
than o
in o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
City I-GPE
and o
more o
than o
in o
Taichung B-GPE
City I-GPE
, o
Miaoli B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
Taichung B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
Changhua B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
Nantou B-GPE
County I-GPE
and o
Yunlin B-GPE
County I-GPE
combined o
. o

Those o
six o
localities o
only o
received o
NT$ o
120 o
billion o
in o
total o
. o

If o
expenditures o
were o
divided o
evenly o
among o
all o
the o
residents o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
, o
each o
would o
receive o
NT$ o
68,000 o
, o
far o
above o
the o
NT$ o
42,000 o
for o
the o
residents o
of o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
, o
the o
NT$ o
25,000 o
for o
residents o
of o
Tainan B-GPE
City I-GPE
or o
the o
NT$ o
17,000 o
for o
the o
residents o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
. o

In o
light o
of o
this o
discrepancy o
, o
it o
's o
no o
wonder o
that o
the o
other o
counties o
and o
cities o
angrily o
look o
upon o
the o
residents o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
as o
" o
first o
- o
class o
citizens o
" o
who o
live o
in o
the o
lap o
of o
luxury o
, o
while o
taking o
everyone o
else o
for o
a o
ride o
. o

These o
first o
- o
class o
citizens o
really o
do o
run o
through o
money o
like o
water o
. o

If o
you o
want o
to o
see o
how o
, o
you o
could o
start o
with o
Taipei B-GPE
's o
Mass o
Rapid o
Transit o
-LRB- o
MRT o
-RRB- o
system o
, o
which o
is o
the o
world o
's o
most o
expensive o
at o
NT$ o
440 o
billion o
; o
the o
Kuandu o
Nature o
Reserve o
, o
for o
which o
Japanese o
experts o
were o
hired o
to o
perform o
wetlands o
restoration o
to o
the o
tune o
of o
NT$ o
14 o
billion o
; o
the o
West B-LOC
Gate I-LOC
District I-LOC
reconstruction o
carried o
out o
in o
conjunction o
with o
the o
building o
of o
the o
MRT o
there o
, o
which o
came o
to o
more o
than o
NT$ o
10 o
billion o
; o
the o
Mucha o
Zoo o
, o
which o
has o
consumed o
NT$ o
30 o
billion o
since o
it o
was o
built o
in o
the o
1970s o
; o
or o
the o
building o
of o
the o
Taipei o
Financial o
Center o
, o
which o
will o
stand o
101 o
stories o
high o
, o
serve o
as o
an o
Asian o
landmark o
, o
and o
cost o
the o
city o
as o
much o
as o
NT$ o
10 o
billion o
. o

Two o
heads o
, o
north o
and o
south o

This o
easy o
- o
come o
, o
easy o
- o
go o
attitude o
toward o
money o
has o
long o
been o
a o
characteristic o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

Ever o
since o
Liu B-PER
Mingchuan I-PER
founded o
Taipei B-GPE
in o
the o
late o
Qing o
dynasty o
, o
rule o
over o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
switched o
from o
nation o
to o
nation o
. o

Yet o
no o
matter o
who o
was o
in o
control o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
not o
been o
shaken o
from o
its o
position o
as o
the o
island o
's o
center o
of o
government o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
" o
It o
has o
only o
been o
ten o
some o
years o
that o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
really o
left o
the o
others o
in o
the o
dust o
, o
" o
argues o
Hsia B-PER
Chu I-PER
- I-PER
joe I-PER
, o
a o
professor o
at o
NTU B-ORG
's o
Graduate B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Building I-ORG
and I-ORG
Planning I-ORG
. o

Hsia B-PER
points o
out o
that o
although o
the o
Governor o
- o
General o
's o
Residence o
was o
located o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
during o
Japanese o
rule o
, o
in o
the o
agricultural o
Taiwan B-GPE
of o
that o
period o
, o
the o
Japanese o
colonial o
administration o
was o
concerned o
about o
rice o
and o
sugar o
production o
over o
the o
entire o
Western B-LOC
Plain I-LOC
and o
treated o
all o
the o
cities o
about o
the o
same o
. o

Moreover o
, o
at o
the o
end o
of o
the o
Japanese o
era o
, o
Japan B-GPE
began o
to o
put o
even o
more o
emphasis o
on o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
as o
a o
base o
for o
its o
advances o
into o
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
. o

This o
gave o
the o
impetus o
for o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
later o
developing o
into o
an o
" o
industrial o
port o

When o
the o
ROC B-GPE
took o
over o
, o
government o
power o
returned o
to o
the o
Governor o
- o
General o
's o
Residence o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
, o
which o
became o
the o
Presidential o
Palace o
. o

Although o
Taipei B-GPE
remained o
the o
political o
and o
economic o
center o
, o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
remained o
as o
an o
important o
center o
of o
heavy o
industry o
. o

Export o
processing o
zones o
established o
in o
the o
1960s o
in o
Nantzu B-GPE
and o
Chienchen B-GPE
attracted o
people o
from o
all o
over o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

In o
the o
1970s o
, o
during o
the o
era o
of o
the o
Ten o
Construction o
Projects o
, o
both o
China B-ORG
Shipbuilding I-ORG
and o
China B-ORG
Steel I-ORG
chose o
to o
locate o
in o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
. o

At o
one o
point o
, o
the o
city o
's o
port o
was o
the o
busiest o
in o
the o
world o
, o
as o
it o
sent o
products o
" o
Made o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
" o
across o
the o
seven o
seas o
. o

It o
thus o
made o
a o
pivotal o
contribution o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
" o
economic o
miracle o
. o
" o

With o
the o
rise o
of o
industry o
in o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
, o
the o
agricultural o
counties o
of o
central o
and o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
began o
to o
lag o
behind o
, o
but o
at o
least o
there o
was o
a o
minimal o
kind o
of o
balance o
on o
the o
island o
as o
a o
whole o
with o
" o
two o
heads o
, o
one o
north o
and o
one o
south o
. o
" o

And o
to o
some o
degree o
the o
provincial o
government o
's o
location o
in o
Nantou B-GPE
- o
and o
the o
resulting o
stream o
of o
visiting o
city o
and o
county o
bureaucrats o
- o
meant o
that o
central o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
n't o
all o
that o
forlorn o
. o

Taichung B-GPE
and o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
step o
out o
! o

Well o
then o
, o
when o
did o
Taipei B-GPE
really o
start o
to o
pull o
ahead o
? o

And o
why o
? o

Hsia B-PER
Chiu I-PER
- I-PER
joe I-PER
explains o
that o
the o
late o
1980s o
were o
an o
important o
turning o
point o
. o

The o
rapid o
appreciation o
of o
the o
NT o
dollar o
necessitated o
a o
shift o
from o
the o
labor o
- o
intensive o
production o
on o
which o
the o
island o
had o
depended o
. o

Japanese o
and o
Western o
manufacturers o
left o
, o
and o
even o
Taiwanese o
companies o
began o
to o
pull o
up o
their o
stakes o
and o
move o
their o
factories o
to o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

What o
's o
more o
, o
there o
was o
a o
growing o
environmental o
consciousness o
that o
led o
the o
residents o
of o
central o
and o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
start o
opposing o
industrial o
projects o
. o

Ten o
years o
ago o
the o
town o
of o
Lukang B-GPE
in o
Changhua B-GPE
County I-GPE
told o
Du B-ORG
Pont I-ORG
to o
look o
elsewhere o
, o
and o
three o
years o
ago o
Taichung B-GPE
County I-GPE
refused o
to o
allow o
Bayer B-ORG
to o
build o
a o
plant o
there o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
other o
multinationals o
planning o
major o
investment o
projects o
stopped o
even o
considering o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o
" o

In o
fact o
, o
what o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
people o
want o
most o
of o
all o
is o
the o
' o
three o
direct o
links o
' o
with o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
" o
says o
Huang B-PER

, o
who o
worked o
for o
the o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
City I-GPE
government o
for o
many o
years o
. o

" o
With o
regularly o
scheduled o
flights o
, o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
could o
turn o
itself o
into o
an o
international o
port o
led o
by o
its o
service o

Investors I-ORG
, o
which o
is o
headquartered o
in o
Central B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
, o
recalls o
that o
ten o
years o
ago o
the o
Taichung B-GPE
city I-GPE
government o
drew o
up o
a o
new o
plan o
for o
the o
city o
that o
called o
for o
straight o
, o
broad o
avenues o
. o

Many o
businesses o
were o
privately o
expecting o
that o
the o
Port o
of o
Taichung o
would o
be o
able o
to o
establish o
direct o
shipping o
links o
with o
the o
mainland o
, o
and o
were o
even o
hoping o
to o
attract o
" o
red o
capital o
" o
from o
across o
the o
strait o
. o

They o
had o
visions o
of o
Taichung B-GPE
establishing o
important o
links o
to o
the B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
or o
even o
to o
the o
global o
community o
. o

Much o
to o
these o
cities o
' o
frustration o
, o
for o
ten o
years o
there o
has o
been o
no o
progress o
on o
the o
" o
three o
direct o
links o
. o
" o

Kaohsiung B-GPE
and o
Taichung B-GPE
have o
excellent o
ports o
, o
but o
they o
are o
like o
besieged o
cities o
with o
nowhere o
to o
go o
. o

Three o
years o
ago o
the o
Tuntex o
Building o
was o
completed o
in o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
. o

At o
81 o
stories o
it o
is o
one o
of o
the o
tallest o
skyscrapers o
in o
Asia B-LOC
. o

Yet o
a o
series o
of o
rumors o
circling o
about o
its o
precarious o
financial o
status o
have o
turned o
it o
into o
a o
symbol o
of o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
's o
falling o
fortunes o
. o

High o
- o
tech o
corridor o

While o
southern o
and o
central o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
fallen o
on o
hard o
times o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
has o
taken o
full o
advantage o
of o
the o
1990s o
trend o
toward o
globalized o
production o
. o

" o
There o
is o
first o
of o
all o
Taipei B-GPE
's o
position o
of o
importance o
both o
for o
the o
economy o
and o
for o
government o
, o
and o
the o
thriving o
science o
park o
in o
Hsinchu B-GPE
, o
" o

chiu I-PER
, o
who o
is o
a o

of o

" o
To o
these o
you o
add o
the o
international o
airport o
in o
Taoyuan B-GPE
and o
the o
construction o
of o
the o
second o
northern o
highway o
, o
and o
what o
you o
get o
is o
a o
' o
high o
- o
tech o
corridor o
' o
from o
Taipei B-GPE
to o
Hsinchu B-GPE
. o
" o

Hsia B-PER
points o
out o
that o
this o
corridor o
extends o
overseas o
, o
eastward o
to o
California B-GPE
's o
Silicon B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
and o
westward o
to o
the o
production o
bases o
in o
the o
Pearl B-LOC
and o
Yangtze B-LOC
river o

on o
the o

. o

Taipei B-GPE
, o
however o
, o
plays o
a o
pivotal o
role o
in o
the o
middle o
, o
linking o
all o
the o
parts o
together o
. o

" o
If o
you o
eat o
somewhere o
like o
the o
Agora o
Garden o
Conference o
Center o
, o
you o
'll o
hear o
people o
all o
around o

saying o
things o
like o
, o
' o
Have o
you o
been o
abroad o
recently o
? o
' o
or o
' o
I o
've o
just o

The o
outstanding o
performance o
of o
Northern B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
's I-LOC
high o
- o
tech o
corridor o
is o
driving o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
economy o
and o
widening o
the o
gap o
between o
north o
and o
south o
. o

Given o
this o
situation o
, o
where o
is o
there o
leverage o
to o
bring o
about o
a o
better o
balance o
between o
north o
and o
south o
? o

Any o
such o
attempt o
will o
hinge o
upon o
the o
central o
government o
working o
to o
redistribute o
wealth o
- o
to o
take o
from o
rich o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
give o
to o
its o
poor o
country o
cousins o
. o

How o
much o
would o
such o
action o
actually o
help o
? o

Although o
redirecting o
some o
of o
the o
billions o
appropriated o
for o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
would o
do o
little o
to o
fundamentally o
change o
the o
economic o
disparity o
, o
many o
experts o
believe o
that o
it o
would o
at o
least o
serve o
as o
a o
comforting o
gesture o
to o
the o
various o
counties o
and o
cities o
crying o
for o
help o
. o

But o
it o
would o
not o
get o
to o
the o
root o
of o
the o
problem o
. o

" o
If o
you o
really o
want o
to o
help o
those o
cities o
and o
counties o
, o
then o
you o
've o
got o
to o
implement o
' o
local o
self o
- o
rule o
, o
' o
so o
that o
the o
local o
governments o
-LRB- o
which o
are o
now o
only o
tertiary o
government o
units o
-RRB- o
really o
acquire o
sufficient o
power o
and o
money o
, o

Otherwise o
, o
if o
the o
" o
southern o
science o
park o
" o
that o
is o
now o
being o
built o
in o
Tainan B-GPE

is o
successful o
, o
perhaps o
it o
, o
in o
combination o
with o
the o
" o
three o

and o
the o

will o
create o

city o
can o
thrive o
or o
wilt o
in o
response o
to o
political o
and o

changes o
to o
a o

These o
developments o
can o
even o
slowly o
and o
silently o
change o
its o
basic o
character o
. o

Taipei B-GPE
's o
character o
is o
much o
different o
than o
those o
of o
other o
Taiwanese o
cities o

" o
In o
attitude o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
is o

First o
of o

the o

as o
the o

as o

, o
only o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
an o
" o
international o
outlook o
. o
" o

Chen B-PER
points o
out o
that o
every o
year o
more o
than o
900,000 o
residents o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
- o
or o
more o
than o
30 o
% o
of o
its o
population o
- o
travel o
overseas o
. o

Hsinchu B-GPE
comes o
in o
second o
at o
28 o
% o

By o
way o
of o
comparison o
, o
only o
6 o
% o
of o
Tainan B-GPE
residents o
and o
5.4 o
% o
of o

the o

just o
another o

may o
well o
know o
more o
about o

in o
Tokyo B-GPE

York I-GPE
than o
about o
Yunlin B-GPE
or o
Hualien B-GPE
, o
" o
notes o
Chen B-PER
. o

You o
can o
see o
one o
example o
after o
another o
of o
how o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
its o
eyes o
on o
the o
world o
and o
fingers o
on o
the o
global o
pulse o
. o

At o
the o
beginning o
of o
September o
, o
the o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
government o
broke o
new o
ground o
by o
sponsoring o
a o
gay o
pride o
festival o
. o

It o
even o
invited o
Michael B-PER
Bronski I-PER
, o
a o
leader o
of o
the o
gay o
pride o
movement o
in o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

The o
event o
was o
fiercely o
opposed o
by o
the o
Presbyterian o
church o
and o
other o
groups o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
but o
it o
clearly o
earned o
points o
with o
foreigners o
who o
participated o
enthusiastically o
and o
saw o
it o
as o
an o
embrace o
of o
tolerance o
and o
diversity o
. o

" o
The o
fact o
is o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
puts o
a o
lot o
of o
effort o
every o
year o
into o
providing o
foreign o
assistance o
and o
sending o
the o
head o
of o

with o

not o
only o
to o

that o

serious o
about o

also o
because o

Last o
December o
the o

Asia o

made o
a o
list o
of o
Asian o
cities o
that o
put o
Taipei B-GPE

Osaka B-GPE
in o
a o
tie o
for o
second o
place o
among o
the o
most o
livable o
cities o
in o

behind o
only o
Fukuoka B-GPE
. o

Taipei B-GPE
was o
up o
three o
places o
from o
the o
year o
before o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
since o
the o
chart o
changes o
year o
to o
year o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
could o
slip o
in o
the o
future o
if o
it o
is o
n't o
careful o
. o

" o
Taipei B-GPE
is o
struggling o
to o
catch o
up o
with o
Tokyo B-GPE
, o
Singapore B-GPE
and o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE

and o
it o
has o

and o
Bangkok B-GPE
running o
fast o
on o
its o
heels o
, o
" o
says o
Chen B-PER

Chen B-PER
points o
out o
that o
with o
the o
PRC B-GPE
lavishing o
resources o
on o
Shanghai B-GPE
, o
the o
city o
was o
able o
to o
complete o
its o
highway o
and o
put o
its o
electric o
cables o
underground o
in o
just o
two o
years o
. o

It o
was o
even o
able o
to o
lay o
down o
an o
entire o
fiber o
optic o
network o
. o

" o
In o
terms o
of o
quality o
and o
diversity o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
is o
ahead o
, o
but o
it o
's o
a o
step o
behind o
when o
it o
comes o
to o
bringing o
out o
the o
pickaxes o
for o
an o
infrastructure o
project o
, o
" o
Chen B-PER
admits o
. o

For o
instance o
, o
there o
has o
long o
been o

currently o
only o
43 o

The o
sewage o
from o
most o
Taipei B-GPE
homes o
pours o
out o
, o
untreated o
, o
into o

The o
capitals o
of o
the o
advanced o
Western o
nations o
would o
never o
have o
allowed o
such o
a o
situation o
to o
persist o
. o

The o
residents o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
regard o
themselves o
as o
citizens o
of o
the o
" o
global o
village o
, o
" o
and o
are o
confident o
in o
facing o
international o
challenges o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
they o
find o
it o
hard o
to o
accept o
the o
current o
government o

Taiwan B-GPE

orientation o
and o
its o
focus o
on o

Recently o
, o
there o
has o
been o
a o
big o
controversy o
about o
which o
romanization o
system o
to o
use o
for o
writing o
Chinese o
characters o
in o
English o
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
government o
insists o
on o
casting o
aside o
the o
Hanyu o
Pinyin o
system o
that o
has o
been o
used o
on o
the o
mainland o
and o
around o
the o
world o
for o
many o
years o
and o
instead o
adopting o
the o
Tongyong o
Pinyin o
system o
, o
which o
has o
been o
specially o
created o
by o
a o
Taiwanese o
scholar o
. o

This o
has o
raised o
the o
hackles o
of o
Lung B-PER
Ying I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
, o
the o
director o
of o
the B-ORG
Taipei I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG

Culture I-ORG
: o
" o
The o
new o
government o
can o
not o
try o
to o
lock o
up o
the o
nation o
. o

It o
can o
not o
put o
the o
elimination o
of o
pan-Chinese o
influences o
as o
the o
starting o
point o
for o
all o
its o
thinking o
! o
" o

Not o
talking o
the o
talk o

With o
its o
international o
orientation o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
also o
has o
a o
much o
different o
attitude o
than o
other o
counties o
and o
cities o
, o
especially o
southern o
ones o
, o
when o
it o
comes o
to o
the o
issue o
of o
independence o
versus o
reunification o
. o

" o
Over o
30 o
% o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
's o
population o
is o
made o
up o
of o
mainlanders o
[ o
those o
who o
fled o
the o
Chinese o
Communists B-ORG
, o
and o
their o
descendants o
] o
, o
" o
explains o
Chen B-PER
Tung I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
. o

" o
This o
figure o
is o
much o
higher o
than o
the o
13 o
% o
average o
in o
the o
nation o
. o
" o

The o
mainlanders o
have o
introduced o
the o
cuisines o
of o
their o
home o
provinces o
and o
a o
longing o
for o
the o
old o
country o
. o

Likewise o
, o
the o
attitudes o
of o
civil o
servants o
loyal o
to o
the o
KMT B-ORG
have o
also o
taken o
firm o
root o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

What o
's o
more o
, o
a o
larger o
proportion o
of o
Hakkas o
live o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
than o
any o
place o
outside o
of o
their o
traditional o
bases o
in o
the o
countryside o
, o
and o
the o
city o
also o
has o
a o
large o
community o
of o
aborigines o
. o

With o
this o
population o
structure o
, o
the o
Taiwanese o
chauvinism o
so o
prevalent o
in o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
rather o
rare o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

Oddly o
, o
as o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
gone o
out o
of o
its o
way o
to o
establish o
ties o
with o
the o
international o
community o
and o
trade o
with o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
it o
has o
, o
whether o
by o
intention o
or o
not o
, o
created o
distance o
between o
itself o
and o
the o
rest o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE

Chen B-PER
Tung I-PER

sheng I-PER
, o
who o
grew o
up o
in o
Shalu B-GPE
, I-GPE
Taichung I-GPE
County I-GPE
and o
has o
a o
strong o
Taiwanese o
consciousness o
, o
remarks o
that o
you o
simply o
ca o
n't o
get o
by o
without o
speaking o
Taiwanese o
south o
of o
the B-LOC
Chuoshui I-LOC
River I-LOC

Only o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
do o
people o
dare o
to o
" o
eat o
Taiwanese o
, o
but o
not o
speak o
Taiwanese o
. o
" o

Both o
in o
terms o
of o
language o
and o
national o
identity o
, o
there o
is o
a o
clear o
" o
split o
between o
north o
and o
south o
. o
" o

To o
take o
the o
simplest o
example o
, o
current o
ROC B-GPE
president o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
had o
an o
outstanding o
record o
as o
mayor o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

Moreover o
, o
he o
wore o
the o
mantle o
of o
being o
a o
" o
Taiwanese o
native o
son o
. o
" o

In o
any o
other o
county o
or o
city o
, o
his o
re-election o
would o
have o
been o
a o
sure o
thing o
. o

But o
in o
the o
1998 o
mayoral o
election o
, o
he o
lost o
by o
more o
than o
100,000 o
votes o
to o
Ma B-PER
Ying I-PER
- I-PER
jeou I-PER
, o
whose o
parents o
came o
over o
from o
the o
mainland o
. o

The o
year o
that o
he o
lost o
, o
Chen B-PER
magnanimously o
said o
, o
" o
a o
first o
- o
rate o
city o
is o
bound o
to o
be o
a o
very o
picky o
city o
. o
" o

He o
did o
so o
to o
show o
that o
he o
bore o
no o
grudge o
, o
but o
perhaps o
his o
statement o
was o
also o
a o
harbinger o
of o
the o
current o
animosity o
between o

In o
the o
eyes o
of o
the o
other o
counties o
and o
cities o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
may o
stand o
alone o
, o
but o
Taipei B-GPE
people o
themselves o
struggle o
with o
their o
sense o
of o
identity o
. o

" o
Taipei B-GPE
is o
a o
classic o
immigrant o
city o
, o
whose o
citizens o
form o
a o
' o
motley o
crew o
, o
' o
" o

Reconstruction I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
and o
an o
associate o
professor o

at o

University I-ORG
. o

" o
Its o
citizens o
may o
all o
earn o
their o
living o
here o
, o
but o
they o
do o
n't o
share o
collective o
memories o
, o
and o
they o
lack o
any o
bonds o
of o
affection o
to o
the o
city o
or o
ties o
to o
personal o
networks o
here o
. o
" o

In o
a o
survey o
he o
conducted o
several o
years o
ago o
, o
Tseng B-PER
found o
that o
only o
one o
in o
five o
Taipei B-GPE
residents o
were o
born o
there o
. o

" o
Ask o
somebody o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
where o
they o
are o
from o
, o
and o
seven o
out o
of o
ten o
will o
say o
they o
are o
mainlanders o
or o
are o
from o
Tainan B-GPE
, o
Pingtung B-GPE
, o
Penghu B-GPE
or o
wherever o
. o

They o
are o
practically o
always o
from o
somewhere o
else o
! o
" o

In o
Tseng B-PER
's o
view o
the o
coming o
decade o
will o
be o
key o
to o
determine o
whether o
the o
city o
can o
transform o
itself o
from o
a o
" o
city o
of o
immigrants o
and o
migrants o
" o
to o
a o
" o
city o
of o
residents o
. o
" o

He o
is o
currently o
promoting o
a o
community o
development o
plan o
in o
the o
hope o
that o
neighborhoods o
full o
of o
strangers o
can o
pull o
together o
, o
and o
people o
living o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
can o
begin o
to o
regard o
it o
as o
their o
" o
new o
hometown o
. o
" o

But o
does o
Tseng B-PER
himself o
consider o
Taipei B-GPE
to o
be o
his o
" o
new o
hometown o
" o
? o

" o
As o
a o
matter o
of o
fact o
, o
I o
feel o
very o
conflicted o
, o
" o
he o
admits o
. o

" o
If o
I o
do o
n't o
move o
back o
to o
my o
hometown o
within o
five o
years o
, o
I o
'll o
probably o
never o
return o
. o
" o

Tseng B-PER
, o
who o
strongly o
identifies o
with o
Tainan B-GPE
County I-GPE
as o
the o
place o
where o
he o
grew o
up o
, o
goes o
back o
every o
month o
to o
visit o
his o
parents o
. o

In o
his o
hometown o
there o
are o
20,000 o
people o
, o
and o
only o
two o
elementary o
schools o
and o
one o
junior o
high o
school o
. o

There o
, o
if o
a o
neighbor o
is o
n't o
a o
relative o
, o
he o
's o
probably o
an o
old o
school o
chum o
or o
co-worker o
. o

You o
really o
get o
a o
hometown o
feeling o
in o
a o
place o
like o
that o
. o

But o
can o
Tainan B-GPE
provide o
him o
with o
career o
opportunities o
? o

Wo o
n't o
his o
children o
lose o
the o
educational o
race o
before o
it o
even o
begins o
? o

He o
has o
seen o
a o
syndrome o
play o
out o
there o
: o
people o
's o
parents o
die o
, o
and o
then o
they o
sell o
their o
farmland o
, o
let o
their o
family o
home o
go o
to o
ruin o
, o
pull o
up o
their o
stakes o
and o
move o
to o
Taipei B-GPE
. o

Because o
he o
knows o
that o
his o
hometown o
needs o
people o
like o
him o
to o
come o
back o
and o
work o
on o
its o
behalf o
, o
he o
really o
feels o
torn o
. o

Missions o
impossible o

" o
While o
many o
cities o
and o
counties o
want o
to o
rediscover o
their o
old o
sense o
of o
self o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
wants o
to o
invent o
a o
self o
- o
identity o
that o
it o
never o
had o
, o
" o
explains o
Tseng B-PER
, o
getting o
at o
the o
crux o
of o
the o
difference o
. o

And o
so o
, o
at o
the o
beginning o
of o
the o
year o
before o
last o
, o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
began o
instituting o
a o
system o
of o
" o
community o
planning o
masters o
. o
" o

These o
unpaid o
volunteers o
selected o
by o
City B-ORG
Hall I-ORG
gather o
suggestions o
and o
criticisms o
from o
residents o
and o
communicate o
with o
the o
elected o
neighborhood o
chiefs o
. o

Then o
, o
after o
establishing o
concrete o
plans o
, o
they o
can o
apply o
to o
the o
city o
for o
financial o
assistance o
to o
implement o
them o
. o

The o
goal o
is o
to o
get o
the o
citizens o
involved o
, o
so o
that o
they o
can o
help o
create o
a o
Taipei B-GPE
that o
they o
feel o
belongs o
to o
them o
. o

" o
Over o
the o
past o
two o
years o
, o
we o
have o
discovered o
that o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
is o
not o
nearly o
as o
cold o
and o
lonely o
as o
we o
had o
once o
imagined o
, o
" o
says o
William B-PER
Chen I-PER
with o
excitement o
. o

In o
order o
to o
expand o
participation o
, o
the o
city o
's o
Urban B-ORG
Development I-ORG
Department I-ORG
this o
year o
has o
begun o
to o
train o
" o
seed o
planning o
masters o
. o
" o

Two o
- o
thirds o
of o
the o
48 o
" o
seed o
students o
" o
are o
professionals o
, o
including o
seven o
who o
have o
doctorates o
. o

The o
high o
quality o
of o
people o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
startled o
Chen B-PER
, o
who o
worked o
for o
a o
long o
time o
in o
the o
provincial o
government o
. o

The o
people o
of o
Taipei B-GPE
can o
be o
proud o
of o
their o
high o
level o
of o
education o
and o
earnings o
and o
their o
discipline o
. o

When o
Chen B-PER
Shui I-PER
- I-PER
bian I-PER
was o
mayor o
he o
launched o
a o
major o
campaign o
against o
the o
sex o
industry o
, o
enforced o
laws o
against o
drinking o
and o
driving o
, o
and o
required o
motorcycle o
drivers o
to o
wear o
helmets o
. o

Even o
Taipei B-GPE
residents o
themselves o
were o
surprised o
at o
their o
ability o
to o
accept o
such o
high o
standards o
. o

Since o
Ma B-PER
Ying I-PER
- I-PER
jeou I-PER
has o
taken o
over o
as o
mayor o
the o
city o
has o
required o
its o
citizens o
to o
take o
on o
another o
duty o
, o
which o
was o
formerly o
regarded o
as o
a o
" o
mission o
impossible o
" o
: o
recycling o
in o
conjunction o
with o
using o
high o
- o
priced o
officially o
approved o
garbage o
bags o
. o

Starting o
in o
July o
of o
this o
year o
, o
most o
Taipei B-GPE
residents o
, o
who o
identify o
themselves o
as o
being o
environmentally o
conscious o
, o
have o
complied o
and o
now o
separate o
their o
garbage o

" o
Although o

City I-GPE
has o
excellent o
financial o
resources o
and o
special o

" o
And o
it o
's o
even o
more o
important o
not o
to o
allow o
political o
or o
party o
differences o
to o
create o
a o
situation o
where o
regions o
clash o
or o
go o
their o

The o
element o
of o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
experience o
that o
is o
most o
worthy o
of o
the o
nation o

pride o
is o
the o
relatively o
even o
distribution o
of o

Yet o
the o
long o
- o
standing o
differences o
between o
Taipei B-GPE
and o
other o
localities o
, o
as o
well o
as o
the o
differences o
in o
ruling o
parties o
, o
get o
in o
the o
way o
. o

Seven o
southern o
counties o

have o
formed o
a o
political o
league o
centered o
around o
Kaohsiung B-GPE

, o
on o
the o
other o

, o
ca o
n't o
even o
get o
along o
with o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
which o
completely o

it o

Ou B-PER
Chin I-PER

te I-PER
admits o
that o
Taipei B-GPE
has o
hardly o
any o
high o
- o
level o
ties o
to o
other o
cities o
and o
counties o
. o

The o
city o
is o
like o
a o
lonely o
island o
or o
a o
proud o
and o
arrogant o
peacock o
, o
fated o
always o
to o
be o
alone o

This o
is o

is o
it o

Internet o
Pioneer o
Heidi B-PER
Hsueh I-PER

When o
the o
Internet o
started o
to o
take o
off o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
1995 o
, o
Inforian B-ORG
was o
one o
of o
the o
first o
Taiwan B-GPE
Internet o
startups o
. o

In o
the o
years o
since o
it o
has o
made o
quite o
a o
splash o
in o
the o
industry o
. o

Back o
when o
the o
Internet o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
mainly o
meant o
college o
students o
posting o
on o
bulletin o
boards o
and o
fooling o
around o
with o
Mosaic o
, o
a o
23 o
- o
year o
- o
old o
graduate o
student o
at o
National B-ORG
Chengchi I-ORG
University I-ORG
named o
Heidi B-PER
Hsueh I-PER
and o
a o
graduate o
student o
at o
National B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
University I-ORG
named o
Lawrence B-PER
Ho I-PER
decided o
to o
form o
an o
Internet o
company o
together o
. o

They o
started o
with o
just o
NT$ o
500,000 o
. o

Hsueh B-PER
, o
who o
speaks o
with o
all o
the o
self o
- o
confidence o
of o
a o
prophet o
, o
recalls o
that o
she o
could o
early o
on o
see o
the o
tremendous o
impact o
that o
the o
Internet o
was o
going o
to o
have o
on o
people o
s o
lives o
. o

" o
We o
were o
riding o
that o
first o
wave o
, o
" o
says o
Hsueh B-PER
, o
who o
points o
out o
that o
deciding o
to o
strike o
at o
the o
right o
time o
is o
the o
first o
step o
to o
success o
. o

Starting o
with o
books o

In o
the o
early o
period o
, o
Inforian B-ORG
- o
or o
pAsia B-ORG
as o
it o
is o
known o
today o
- o
made o
money o
by o
publishing o
books o
and o
by o
localizing o
software o
for o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
market o
. o

Hsueh B-PER
, o
the o
co-founder o
and o
executive o
vice o
president o
, o
ca o
n't o
count o
how o
many o
times o
she o
stayed o
up o
all o
night o
at o
the o
office o
in o
those o
early o
days o
. o

Once o
, o
when o
their o
distributor o
for o
some o
reason o
refused o
to o
make o
payments o
, o
they o
had o
to o
endure o
two o
months o
without o
any o
incoming o
revenue o
. o

" o
When o
you o
're o
considering o
founding o
a o
company o
, o
" o
she o
says o
, o
issuing o
a o
warning o
to o
the o
many o
youths o
throwing o
themselves o
into o
Internet o
startups o
, o
" o
you o
've o
really o
got o
to o
consider o
carefully o
the o
pressures o
you o
're o
going o
to o
be o
under o
. o
" o

The o
division o
of o
labor o
was o
clear o
from o
the o
start o
. o

Ho B-PER
was o
responsible o
for o
product o
design o
, o
and o
Hsueh B-PER
handled o
business o
development o
and o
marketing o
strategy o
. o

After o
two o
years o
, o
the o
company o
had o
its o
first o
success o
: o
the o
IQ97 o
-LRB- o
Inforian B-ORG
Quest o
-RRB- o
meta o
- o
search o
engine o
. o

It o
hit o
a o
homerun o
for o
their o
Internet o
dreams o
. o

Not o
long o
after o
Ho B-PER
finished o
IQ97 o
, o
Hsueh B-PER
sent o
it o
to o
the o
American o
website o
ZDNet B-ORG
, o
which o
awarded o
it o
five o
stars o
, o
its o
highest o
rating o
. o

Hsueh B-PER
then o
used o
the o
Internet o
to o
find o
distributors o
around o
the o
world o
. o

Soon o
IQ97 o
had o
been o
translated o
into o
seven o
languages o
and o
plans o
were o
laid o
to o
step o
into o
the o
global o
market o
. o

Within o
a o
year o
of o
the o
product o
's o
release o
in o
October o
of o
1997 o
, o
it o
had o
sold o
three o
million o
copies o
worldwide o
. o

Inforian B-ORG
followed o
by o
launching o
CICQ o
, o
a o
Chinese o
language o
instant o
messaging o
site o
that o
attracted o
1 o
million o
members o
from o
around o
the o
world o
. o

Then o
in o
1998 o
it o
focused o
on o
e-commerce o
, o
establishing o
the o
online o
auction o
site o
CoolBid B-ORG
, o
which o
has o
averaged o
quarterly o
sales o
of o
NT$ o
60 o
million o
and o
has o
as o
many o
as o
100,000 o
members o
. o

Hsueh B-PER
also o
made o
plans o
to o
forge o
alliances o
with o
world o
- o
famous o
companies o
. o

In o
1998 o
, o
after o
seeing o
Hsueh B-PER
's o
strategic o
alliance o
plan o
, o
Intel B-ORG
joined o
Inforian B-ORG
as o
a o
strategic o
partner o
. o

Later o
, o
it o
decided o
to o
take o
a o
stake o
in o
the o
company o
. o

It o
was o
the o
first o
time o
Intel B-ORG
had o
ever o
invested o
in o
an o
Asian o
Internet o
company o
. o

Inforian B-ORG
, o
or o
pAsia B-ORG
as o
it o
is o
now o
known o
, o
has o
grown o
from o
four o
employees o
to o
a o
staff o
of o
several o
hundred o
, o
and o
has o
become o
a o
multinational o
with o
offices o
in o
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and o
on o
the o
mainland o
, o
as o
well o
as o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE

The o
Internet o
lifestyle o

" o
At o
pAsia B-ORG
we o
emphasize o
that o
the o
Internet o
is o
a o
kind o
of o
technological o
art o
that o
allows o
people o
to o
improve o
their o
lifestyle o
, o
" o
Hsueh B-PER
says o
. o

" o
This o
is o
a o
work o
of o
art o
that o
requires o
creativity o
to o
be o
whole o
. o

The o
Internet o
is o
part o
software o
, o
part o
media o
, o
part o
databank o
, o
and o
part o
communications o
device o
. o

It o
's o
the o
best o
possible o
space o
for o
making o
the o
most o
out o
of o
creativity o
. o

" o
On o
the o

and o
the o

each o

with o
their o
respective o
presences o
. o

Hsueh B-PER
notes o
that o
those o
two o
historical o
figures o
' o
hard o
work o
and o
creativity o
changed o
the o
way o
people o
live o
. o

This o
is o
also o
the o
spirit o
that o
pAsia B-ORG
wishes o
to o
project o
. o

As o
far o
as o
Hsueh B-PER
is o
concerned o
, o
the o
Internet o
is o
both o
a o
tool o
and o
a o
communications o
platform o
. o

Internet o
companies o
, o
she o
believes o
, o
should o
reflect o
that o
. o

As o
one o
such o
company o
, o
pAsia B-ORG
must o
be o
flexible o
, o
efficient o
and o
practice o
what o
it o
preaches o
. o

The o
intranet o
at o
pAsia B-ORG
, o
for o
instance o
, o
provides o
chatrooms o
, o
vacation o
request o
forms o
, o
work o
guidelines o
, o
business o
travel o
forms o
, o
and o
even o
a o
bulletin o
board o
for o
selling o
workers o
' o
second o
- o
hand o
stuff o
. o

The o
offices o
have o
neon o
decorations o
on o
the o
walls o
and o
a o
hallway o
that o
is o
no o
less o
stylish o
than o
a o
haute o
couture o
catwalk o
. o

The o
whole o
office o
is o
infused o
with o
a o
modern o
and o
technological o
sensibility o
. o

Of o
course o
, o
success o
is o
never o
guaranteed o
. o

American B-ORG
Tech I-ORG
stocks o
took o
a o
tumble o
in o
April o
of o
this o
year o
, o
and o
people o
began o
to o
talk o
about o
an o
Internet o
bubble o
. o

Meanwhile o
, o
pAsia B-ORG
has o
had o
trouble o
obtaining o
new o
financing o
and o
has o
seen o
rapid o
turnover o
in o
its o
executive o
ranks o
, o
while o
rumors o
have o
circulated o
about o
its o
IPO o
application o
being o
rejected o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
Hsueh B-PER
holds o
that o
pAsia B-ORG
has o
a o
clear o
niche o
and o
is o
very o
adaptable o
, o
so o
that o
it o
will o
be o
relatively o
unaffected o
by o
the o
economic o
downturn o
. o

When o

's I-PER
fresh o
young o
face o
and o
her o
no o

nonsense o
approach o
to o
doing o

, o
you o
quickly o
understand o
how o

of o
the o
young o
generation o
are o
realizing o
their o
revolutionary o
ideas o
about o

Closing o
ceremonies o
for o
the o
2000 o

held o
on o
October o

. o

Nearly o
4000 o
athletes o
from o
more o
than o
one o
hundred o
and o
twenty o
countries o
participated o
. o

This o
event o
, o
a o
manifestation o
of o
the o
ideal o
that o
" o
the o
flame o
burns o
in o
the o
body o
, o
mind o
, o
and o
spirit o
of o
every o
individual o
, o
" o
broke o
down o
international o
barriers o
and o
was o
an o
admirable o
example o
of o
the o
global o
village o
in o
operation o
. o

The o
ROC B-GPE
team o
took o
one o
gold o
, o
two o

, o
and o
four o

, o
marking o
the o
first o
time o
any o

only o
foreign o

invited o
by o
the o
Australian o
government o
to o
participate o
in o
the o
Paralympic o
Arts o
Festival o
. o

But o
even o
more o
important o
than o
these o
honors o
was o
the o
spirit o
of o
overcoming o
all o
obstacles o
and o
facing o
life o
with o
courage o
that o
shone o
through o
during o
the o
Paralympics o
. o

The o
just o

completed o

were o
enriched o
by o
ethnic o
flavorings o
. o

The o

on o
October o

was o
in o
the o
form o
of o
a o

Amidst o
a o
festive o
atmosphere o
, o
the o

with o

The o
1.1 o
million o

show o
the o
extent o
to o
which o
everyone o
took o
the o
games o
seriously o
. o

The o
host o

even o
set o
up o
a o
huge o
TV o

in o
Darwin B-GPE
, o
which o
is o
the o

of o
entry o
for o
the o
most o
visitors o
to o
Australia B-GPE
, o
to o
broadcast o
the o

. o

The o
games o
were o
also o
a o
platform o
for o
the o
idea o
of o
the o
welfare o
state o
caring o
for o

and o
for o

A o
saying o
has o
it o
that o
" o
knowledge o
is o
power o
. o
" o

But o
here o
at o
the o
turn o
of o
the o
century o
, o
people o
are o
discovering o
that o
knowledge o
is o
more o
than o
just o
power o
; o
it o
is o
also o
profit o
. o

Responding o
to o
the o
new o
realities o
, o
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
has o
put o
forward o
a o
plan o
to o
develop o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
" o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
" o
which o
aims o
to o
double o
per o
capita o
income o
within o
ten o
years o
. o

This o
plan o
embraces o
the o
long-term o
economic o
goals o
of o
the o
new o
administration o
. o

But o
what o
is o
covered o
under o
the o
rubric o
of o
developing o
the o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
? o

What o
conditions o
are o
required o
to o
be o
successful o
? o

Does o
Taiwan B-GPE
meet o
these o
criteria o
? o

Did o
you o
know o
that o
90 o
% o
of o
the o
knowledge o
in o
the o
world o
has o
been o
produced o
in o
the o
half o
century o
since o
the o
end o
of o
World o
War o
II o
? o

And o
in o
20 o
years o
, o
what o
we o
know o
today o
will o
be o
only o
one o
percent o
of o
the o
total o
knowledge o
bank o
of o
our o
children o
! o

" o
It o
is o
estimated o
that o
the o
pool o
of o
human o
knowledge o
doubled o
once o
every o
fifty o
years o
in o
the o
19th o
century o
, o
and o
about o
once o
every o
ten o
years o
in o
the o
20th o
century o
. o

Now o
it o
doubles o
once o
every o
three o
to o
five o
years o

The o
explosive o
growth o
of o
information o
is o
the o
most o
distinctive o
feature o
of o
the o
20th o
century o
, o
and o
has o
brought o
sweeping o
changes o
to o
the o
world o
's o
political o
, o
social o
, o
and o
economic o
structure o
. o

Profit o
defines o
value o

In o
1992 o
, o
shortly o
after o
US B-GPE
president o
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
took o
office o
, o
he o
declared o
that o
emphasis o
should o
be o
placed o
on o
research o
and o
development o
and o
on o
creating o
a o
" o
new o
economy o
. o
" o

It o
turns o
out o
that o
these o
last o
eight o
years o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
have o
been o
a o
golden o
age o
of o
high o
economic o
growth o
, o
falling o
unemployment o
, o
and o
stable o
prices o
. o

In o
1996 o
, o
the o
OECD B-ORG
coined o
the o
term o
" o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
, o
" o
and o
many o
governments o
have o
jumped o
on o
the o
bandwagon o
since o
. o

You o
can o
call o
it o
the o
" o
new o
economy o
" o
or o
the o
" o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
" o
or o
whatever o
, o
but o
what o
is o
it o
really o
? o

How o
can o
such o
an o
economy o
be o
created o
? o

Because o
each o
country o
has o
different o
development o
needs o
, o
there o
are o
many o
different o
answers o
to o
these o
questions o
. o

Wu B-PER
Se-hwa I-PER
points o
out o
that o
the o
term o
" o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
" o
refers o
to o
any o
economic o
activity o
based o
on o
the o
production o
or o
application o
of o
knowledge o
, o
in o
which o
" o
knowledge o
" o
includes o
all o
kinds o
of o
technology o
, o
patents o
, o
management o
know-how o
, o
and o
individual o
creations o
. o

It o
is o
not o
important o
how o
profound o
or o
esoteric o
the o
knowledge o
may o
be o
; o
what o
matters o
most o
is o
turning o
that o
knowledge o
into o
a o
product o
which o
can o
earn o
a o
profit o
. o

Looking o
back o
at o
the o
economic o
history o
of o
the o
West B-LOC
, o
in o
16th o
century o
society o
, o
agricultural o
products o
were o
the o
key o
to o
wealth o
and o
power o
. o

Whoever o
had o
the o
most o
, o
and o
most o
fertile o
, o
land o
was o
in o
a o
dominant o
position o
. o

In o
the o
industrial o
age o
, o
capitalists o
who o
commanded o
the o
wealth o
to o
buy o
machinery o
and o
hire o
workers o
, o
or o
who o
owned o
critical o
resources o
like o
coal o
and o
oil o
, o
replaced o
landowners o
as o
the o
dominant o
figures o
in o
the o
economy o
. o

But o
today o
, o
whoever o
owns o
systematized o
knowledge o
will o
win o
out o
over o
his o
or o
her o
competitors o
. o

When o
Lester B-PER
Thurow I-PER
, o
the o
well o
- o
known o
economist o
from o
the B-ORG
Massachusetts I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
, o
came o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
give o
a o
lecture o
a o
half o
year o
ago o
, o
he o
pointed o
to o
the B-ORG
Microsoft I-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
as o
a o
prime o
example o
: o
Microsoft B-ORG
owns o
no o
farmland o
, o
no o
oil o
fields o
, o
no o
expensive o
and o
sophisticated o
factories o
, o
and o
no o
shops o
of o
its o
own o
. o

Its o
product o
fits o
onto o
a o
tiny o
microchip o
. o

Yet o
this o
company o
, o
relying o
only o
on o
the o
brainpower o
of o
several o
thousand o
engineers o
sitting o
in o
front o
of o
computers o
writing o
programs o
, o
has o
earned o
billions o
upon o
billions o
of o
dollars o
for o
owner o
Bill B-PER
Gates I-PER
. o

It o
is o
estimated o
that o
300 o
million o
persons o
use o
Microsoft B-ORG

each o
day o
around o

with o

Knowledge o

dish o

In o
the o
past o
, o
Chinese o
people o
discovered o
much o
knowledge o
and o
invented o
much o
technology o
, o
but o
, o
influenced o
by o
the o
Confucian o
belief o
that o
profit o
was o
not o
a o
worthy o
application o
of o
wisdom o
, o
never o
converted o
these o
into o
commercial o
products o
. o

But o
in o
the o
face o
of o
today o
's o
dramatic o
global o
economic o
transformation o
, o
there o
is o
no o
choice o
but o
to o
try o
to o
turn o
knowledge o
into o
profit o
. o

And o
the o
thing o
that o
links o
knowledge o
with o
profit o
is o
information o
technology o

IT o

, o
whose o
company o
has o
twice o
won o
national o
awards o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o
its o
fingerprint o
verification o
device o
, o
says o
that o
human o
history o
can o
be o
seen o
as o
the o
history o
of o
information o
. o

When o
Marco B-PER
Polo I-PER
visited o
the o
East B-LOC
in o
the o
13th o
century o
, o
if o
he o
had o
not o
left o
a o
written o
account o
of o
his o
travels o
, o
it o
would o
have o
been o
a o
virtually o
wasted o
trip o
. o

The o
recent o
enthusiasm o
for o
the o
Taipei B-GPE
exhibition o
of o
terracotta o
warriors o
from o
Xi'an B-GPE
is o
due o
to o
the o
fact o
that o
these o
long o
- o
buried o
figures o
contain o
information o
about o
mysteries o
dating o
back o
2000 o
years o
. o

Hsu B-PER
Wen-hsing I-PER
points o
out o
that o
in o
the o
past o
information o
was o
always o
tied o
to o
material o
objects o
, o
and o
remained o
in o
the o
hands o
of o
the o
few o
. o

When o
the o
material o
objects o
disappeared o
, o
so o
did o
the o
information o
they o
contained o
. o

But o
now o
, o
thanks o
to o
IT o
, o
for o
the o
first o
time o
in o
history o
information o
can o
be o
forever o
stored o
in o
huge o
volume o
, o
ready o
and o
waiting o
to o
be o
manipulated o
, o
exchanged o
, o
and o
even o
sent o
across o
great o
distances o
. o

IT o
is o
like o
a o
petrie o
dish o
. o

Information o
cells o
swim o
around o
in o
it o
, o
and o
can o
divide o
, o
recombine o
, o
reproduce o
, o
and o
copy o
themselves o
without o
limit o
, o
opening o
up o
entirely o
new o
possibilities o
for o
the o
accumulation o
and o
application o
of o
knowledge o
. o

For o
example o
, o
computers o
are o
capable o
of o
finding o
numbers o
hidden o
under o
or o
scattered o
throughout o
a o
huge o
pile o
of o
data o
which o
is o
impenetrable o
to o
the o
human o
brain o
, o
and o
can o
analyze o
and o
clarify o
these o
numbers o
into o
useful o
know-how o
. o

" o
One o
order o
form o
is o
not o
information o
. o

But o
, o
by o
using o
a o
computer o
to o
save o
, o
connect o
, o
and o
search o
individual o
order o
forms o
, o
one o
can o
draw o
a o
thread o
through o
tens o
of o
thousands o
of o
them o
, o
and o
discern o
their o
regularities o
and o
variations o
. o

Now o
that o
's o
knowledge o
, o
" o
declares o
Simon B-PER
Chang I-PER
, o
president o
of o
Acer B-ORG
CyberCenter I-ORG
Services I-ORG
. o

At o
a o
glance o
you o
can o
find o
information o
such o
as o
regional o
and o
seasonal o
variations o
in o
sales o
, o
or o
market o
acceptance o
of o
a o
given o
product o
. o

And o
if o
there o
is o
a o
problem o
, o
it o
can o
be o
identified o
immediately o
, o
avoiding o
guesswork o
and o
wasted o
time o
. o

Everyone o
a o
multibillionaire o
! o

In o
the o
information o
world o
, o
everyone o
is o
equal o
. o

Though o
huge o
multinational o
corporations o
may o
have o
an o
edge o
in o
terms o
of o
information o
technology o
, o
since o
the o
rapid o
growth o
of o
the o
Internet o
in o
the o
1990s o
, o
' o
little o
guys o
' o
whom o
no o
one o
has o
ever o
heard o
of o
before o
- o
relying o
only o
on o
programming o
ability o
, o
creativity o
, o
and o
hard o
work o
- o
have o
had o
the o
space o
to o
bring o
their o
talents o
into o
play o
. o

The o
best o
- o
known o
example o
is o
Yahoo B-ORG
, o
the o
world o
's o
number o
one o
web o
portal o
. o

It o
all o
started o
with o
two o
Stanford B-ORG
PhD o
students o
looking o
for o
a o
way o
to o
categorize o
the o
websites o
online o
, o
who o
came o
up o
with o
a o
great o
idea o
for o
a o
way o
to o
make o
finding o
information o
easier o
for o
Internet o
users o
. o

With o
this o
idea o
, o
after o
six o
years o
of o
hard o
work o
, o
today o
Yahoo B-ORG
has o
a o
market o
value o
of o
US$ o
50 o
billion o
. o

Over o
the o
past o
five o
years o
profits o
have o
grown o
at o
a o
rate o
of o
9800 o
% o
, o
which o
has o
got o
to o
be o
some o
kind o
of o
record o
. o

However o
, o
though o
knowledge o
may o
be o
profitable o
, o
its o
value o
is o
subject o
to o
severe o
fluctuation o
. o

, o
notes o
that o
in o
the o
past o
you o
could o
determine o
the o
worth o
of o
a o
company o
by o
adding o
up o
its o
fixed o
assets o
-LRB- o
such o
as o

and o
liquid o

such o
as o
cash o
-RRB- o
, o
with o
each o
calculable o
down o
to o
the o
last o
penny o
. o

But o
knowledge o
is o
intangible o
. o

Two o
different o
software o
packages o
burned o
onto o
identical o
chips o
can o
have o
grossly o
different o
values o
. o

Sometimes o
it o
all o
depends o
on o
luck o
or o
fads o
. o

The o
dramatic o
rise o
and o
fall o
of o
US B-GPE
software o
stocks o
this o
past o
year o
reflects o
the o
difficulty o
of o
assessing o
the o
value o
of o
knowledge o
. o

Wu B-PER
Se-hwa I-PER
points o
to o
Intel B-ORG
as o
a o
prime o
example o
of o
how o
knowledge o
can o
" o
convert o
silicon o
to o
gold o
. o
" o

A o
name o
- o
card o
sized o

is o
in o
fact o
just o

chipboard o
with o
complicated o
circuitry o
, o
with o
a o
unit o
cost o
of o
less o
than o
US$ o
35 o
. o

But o
because o
it o
includes o
unique o
information o
that o
makes o
the o
computer o
run o
, o
and o
carries o
the o
authority o
of o
" o

inside o
, o
" o
it o
can o

over o

1000 o

What o
about o

Clearly o
there o
is o
already o
a o
global o
trend o
in o
which o
an o
information o

is o
taking o

What o
advantages o
does o

for o

a o

in o
this o

the o

region o
in o
the o
emerging o
geography o
of o
the o

Taiwan B-GPE
currently o
ranks o
fourth o
in o
the o
world o
in o
value o
of o

, o
and o
, o
if o

In o

Taiwan B-GPE
has o
a o
solid o
manufacturing o

and o
a o
large o
pool o
of o

says o
that o
right o
now o
what o
the o
government o
is o
focusing o
on o
and o
what o
stock o
market o
players o
most o
hope o
for o
is o
a o
US B-GPE
- o
style o
" o
new o
economy o
. o
" o

The o
focus o
is o
on o
new o
industries o
, o
such o
as o
software o
and o
the o
Internet o
, o
or o
communications o
technology o
, o
fiber o
- o
optics o
, o
biotechnology o
, o
and o
the o
like o
. o

But o
can o
the o
American o
model o
be o
reproduced o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
? o

There o
is o
little o
reason o
to o
be o
optimistic o
. o

The o
new o
economy o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
depends o
heavily o
, o
for o
one o
thing o
, o
on o
a o
deep o
foundation o
of o
basic o
scientific o
research o
, o
which o
comes o
up o
with o
revolutionary o
products o
like o
genetically o
modified o
foods o
. o

Another o
key o
factor o
is o
that o
the o
US B-GPE
has o
a o
mechanism o
for o
innovation o
and o
entrepreneurship o
, o
so o
that o
new o
ideas o
have o
a o
chance o
to o
be o
brought o
into o
play o
. o

The o
rapid o
growth o
in o
the o
new o
economy o
has o
driven o
a o
decade o
- o
long o
economic o
boom o
in o
the o
States B-GPE
. o

The o
old o
manufacturing o
economy o
has o
naturally o
been o
trimmed o
back o
, o
with o
factories o
relocating o
overseas o
, o
but o
American o
firms o
can o
depend o
on o
the o
rights o
to o
technology o
to o
earn o
a o
profit o
. o

subsidiary o
of o
the o
giant o
US B-GPE
semiconductor o
equipment o
manufacturer o
of o
the o
same o
name o
, o
points o
to o
a o
prime o
example o
: o
DRAM o
, o
the o
hottest o
industry o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
which o
was o
a o
monopoly o
of o
the o
US B-GPE
firm o
Texas B-ORG
Instruments I-ORG
. o

Tan B-PER
notes o
that o
although o
DRAM o
factories o
are o
closing o
one o
after o
another o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
patent o
royalties o
must o
still o
be o
paid o
to o
Texas B-ORG
Instruments o
for o
each o
and o
every o
one o
of o
the o
more o
than o
100 o
million o
DRAMs o
produced o
around o
the o
world o
annually o
. o

This o
is o
a o
classic o
" o
knowledge o
goose o
that o
lays o
golden o
eggs o
. o
" o

The o
new o
economy o
is o
a o
weapon o
by o
which o
the o
US B-GPE
dominates o
the o
world o
, o
with o
" o
the o
export o
of o
knowledge o
" o
replacing o
the o
export o
of o
goods o
. o

Yet o
, o
in o
the o
entire o
world o
, o
only o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
Japan B-GPE
, o
and o
the o
UK B-GPE
export o
more o
technology o
than o
they o
import o
. o

In o
other o
words o
, o
only o
these o
three o
countries o
have o
a o
surplus o
in o
" o
knowledge o
trade o
, o
" o
and o
can o
make o
money o
by o
selling o
knowledge o
. o

Of o
these o
three o
, o
US B-GPE
income o
from o
selling o
technology o
is o
four o
times o
the o
amount o
it o
spends o
buying o
technology o
elsewhere o
, o
and o
it o
earns o
enough o
each o
year o
in o
patent o
royalties o
to o
balance o
its o
enormous o
deficit o
in o
manufactured o
goods o
. o

In o
contrast o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
still o
showing o
a o
nasty o
deficit o
in o
knowledge o
trade o
, o
with o
money o
going o
out o
twice o
as o
fast o
as o
it o
is o
coming o
in o
. o

The o
impressive o
American o
model o
would o
certainly o
be o
difficult o
to o
apply o
to o
the o
small o
" o
shallow o
" o
economy o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

As o
Ko B-PER
Chen-en I-PER
, o
dean o
of o
the B-ORG
College I-ORG
of I-ORG
Management I-ORG
at o
National B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
University I-ORG
, o
puts o
it o
: o
" o
You o
merely o
have o
to o
ask o
how o
many o
Nobel o
Prize o
winners o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
- o
not o
many o
- o
and o
you o
know o
its o
real o
ability o
to o
follow o
the o
US B-GPE
economic o
model o
. o
" o

Ko B-PER
relates o
that o
" o
high-risk o
and o
high-profit o
" o
revolutionary o
new o
technologies o
can o
normally o
only o
be o
created o
with o
enormous o
financial o
backing o
. o

In o
1999 o
, o
total o
expenditures o
on o
R-AMP-D o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
by o
both o
the o
government o
and o
private o
sector o
were o
a o
mere o
NT$ o
200 o
billion o
-LRB- o
about o
US o
$ o
6 o
billion o
-RRB- o
, o
less o
than o
was o
spent o
by o
IBM B-ORG
alone o
. o

Slow o
improvement o

In o
contrast o
to o
the o
" o
picking o
stars o
from o
the o
sky o
" o
US B-GPE
model o
, o
says o
Wu B-PER
Se-hwa I-PER
, o
" o
the o
European o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
concept o
is o
closer o
to o
what o
Taiwan B-GPE
needs o
. o
" o

As o
Wu B-PER
explains o
, o
the o
OECD B-ORG
definition o
of o
the o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
embraces o
all o
kinds o
of o
industries o
, o
from o
Italian o
shoes o
to o
Dutch o
flowers o
. o

Any o
industry o
that o
increases o
its o
knowledge o
component o
, o
using o
knowledge o
to o
improve o
management o
, o
innovate o
, o
or o
improve o
quality o
, o
can o
be o
considered o
a o
knowledge o
industry o
. o

This o
is o
a o
much o
more o
practical o
ambition o
for o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
which o
has o
a o
high o
proportion o
of o
traditional o
industry o
and o
is o
extremely o
dependent o
on o
OEM o
manufacturing o
to o
make o
money o
. o

In o
1998 o
Taiwan B-GPE
had o
more o
than o
4500 o
patents o
approved o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
ranking o
fourth o
. o

But o
not o
many o
of o
these o
were o
for o
original o
discoveries o
; o
most o
were o
in o
the o
category o
of o
improvements o
of o
old o
ideas o
, o
mainly o
ways o
to o
increase o
efficiency o
in o
the o
manufacturing o
process o
. o

Innovations o
that o
are o
improvements o
require o
less o
money o
for o
R-AMP-D o
, o
and o
do o
not o
require o
genius-like o
creativity o
, o
but o
can o
be o
made o
primarily o
by o
devoting o
more o
attention o
to o
a o
specific o
problem o
. o

S.T. B-PER
Day I-PER
, o
chairman o
of o

the o

in o
point o
: o
On o
most o
caps o
there o
is o
an o
" o
eyelet o
" o
in o
the o
stitching o
. o

But o
, o
because o
of o
different o
machine o
designs o
, o
the o
gap o
can o
be o
80 o
, o
90 o
, o
or o
100 o
stitches o
, o
creating o
problems o
for o
quality o
control o
. o

San B-ORG
Sun I-ORG
created o
a o
computer o
program o
that o
ensures o
that o
machines o
leave o
a o
uniform o
gap o
of o
95 o
stitches o
, o
and o
even o
gets o
the o
machines o
to o
tie o
a o
lovely o
knot o
when o
the o
sticthcing o
is o
completed o
. o

This o
seemingly o
small o
improvement o
actually o
allows o
the o
firm o
to o
charge o
double o
the o
unit o
price o
per o

. o

Day B-PER
has o
factories o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
mainland o
China B-GPE
, o
and o
Dominica B-GPE
. o

Wages o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
are o
15 o
times o
greater o
than o
in o
the o
PRC B-GPE
, o
and o
100 o
times o
greater o
than o
in o
Burma B-GPE
. o

" o
If o
Taiwan B-GPE
workers o
just o
make o
hats o
and o
do o
nothing o
else o
, o
then o
it o
does o
n't o
pay o
. o

But o
if o
, o
because o
of o
their o
higher o
quality o
, o
these o
workers o
come o
up o
with o
their o
own o
ideas o
for o
improving o
the o
production o
process o
, o
then o
they o
are o
worth o
it o
, o
" o
says o
Day B-PER
with o
the o
voice o
of o
experience o
. o

He o
says o
that o
in o
assessing o
the o
value o
of o
employees o
, o
you o
have o
to o
look o
at o
more o
than o
just o
the o
value o
of o
the o

; o
you o
have o
to o
also o
take o
into o
account o
its o
" o

San B-ORG

it o

which o

a o
tremendous o
impact o
in o

these o

two o
years o
, o
and o
which o
is o
even o

has o
adopted o
a o
different o
strategy o
for o
gradually o
expanding o
its o
territory o
. o

William B-PER
Lee I-PER
, o
who o
works o
in o
public o
relations o
at o
VIA B-ORG
, o
says o
that o
the o
production o
of o
chipsets o
is o
a o
high o
risk o
activity o
. o

So o
, o
taking o
advantage o
of o
the o
boom o
in o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
stock o
market o
over o
the o
past o
two o
years o
, o
the o
company o
went o
on o
a o
binge o
of o
hiring o
, o
acquisitions o
, o
and o
strategic o
alliances o
, o
expanding o
in o
size o
rapidly o
. o

Lee B-PER
says o
that o
in o
the o
past o
, o
VIA B-ORG
's o
chipsets o
were o
designed o
completely o
to o
support o
Intel B-ORG
specification o
CPUs o
. o

In o
1998 o
, o
when o
Intel B-ORG
insisted o
on o
sticking o
with o
expensive o
Rambus B-ORG
memory o
chips o
despite o
a o
poor o
market o
response o
, o
VIA B-ORG
saw o
its o
opportunity o
: o

It o
began o
promoting o
use o
of o
the o
P133 o
memory o
chip o
, o
which o
had o
been o
created o
by o
an o
international o
consortium o
and o
was o
provided o
to o
factories o
free o
of o
charge o
. o

For o
the o
first o
time o
, o
VIA B-ORG
had o
challenged o
the o
" o
big o
boss o
, o
" o
Intel B-ORG
. o

In o
the o
latter o
half o
of o
1999 o
, o
VIA B-ORG
acquired o
two o
CPU o
companies o
in o
the o
States B-GPE
, o
giving o
it o
an o
independent o
ability o
to o
develop o
CPUs o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
half o
a o
year o
ago o
it o
entered o
into o
cooperation o
with o
the o
US B-GPE
graphics o
powerhouse o
S3 o
to o
make o
graphics o
chips o
. o

In o
these o
ways o
, o
VIA B-ORG
is o
moving o
step o
by o
step o
to o
enlarge o
its o
intellectual o
holdings o
. o

" o
You o
have o
to o
have o
a o
lot o
of o
technology o
already o
on o
hand o
before o
you o
can o
start o
talking o
about o
systematic o
integration o
and o
trying o
out o
major o
innovations o
, o
" o
says o
Lee B-PER
. o

It o
is o
only o
now o
that o
VIA B-ORG
can o
escape o
from o
the o
specifications o
dictated o
by o
large o
multinational o
firms o
, o
and o
create o
innovative o
products o
of o
its o
own o
. o

To o
meet o
future o
market o
demand o
for o
home o
appliances o
that o
are o
inexpensive o
, o
multi-functional o
, o
and o
portable o
, o
the o
main o
direction o
will o
be o
to o
get o
all o
the o
functions o
on o
to o
a o
single o
chip o
. o

VIA B-ORG
has o
designed o
a o
new o
3 o
- o
in o
- o
1 o
chipset o
which o
includes o
CPU o
, o
memory o
, o
and o
graphics o
, o
which o
are o
expected o
to o
formally o
hit o
the o
market o
in o
the o
first o
half o
of o
2001 o
. o

As o
Lee B-PER
reveals o
: o
" o
No o
one o
has o
ever o
done o
this o
before o
. o

We o
are o
trying o
something o
new o
. o
" o

Save o
the o
idiots o
! o

Nonetheless o
, o
knowledge o
and o
creativity o
are o
intangible o
, o
and o
it o
is o
not o
always o
easy o
to o
determine o
ownership o
. o

This o
is o
especially o
problematic o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
where o
some o
people o
still o
do o
n't o
have o
a o
very o
clear o
idea o
about o
intellectual o
property o
rights o
, o
and o
legal o
protections o
are o
less o
than o
comprehensive o
. o

This o
is o
a o
potential o
problem o
for o
the o
development o
of o
the o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

" o
Many o
innovations o
just o
represent o
going o
a o
little o
bit o
further o
in o
thinking o
about o
a o
problem o
than o
the o
other o
guys o
, o
and o
once o
the o
secret o
is o
uncovered o
, o
it o
is o
easy o
for o
them o
to o
copy o
the o
idea o
, o
" o
says o
Simon B-PER
Chang I-PER
. o

The o
most o
famous o
example o
in o
the o
industry o
involves o
a o
certain o
company o
that o
wanted o
to o
create o
information o
systems o
like o
storage o
and o
document o
handling o
. o

It o
invited o
a o
number o
of o
information o
industry o
firms o
to o
give o
briefings o
on o
their o
products o
. o

After o
a o
while o
, o
this o
former o
" o
outsider o
" o
became o
an o
insider o
, o
and o
created o
its o
own o
product o
, o
congratulating o
itself o
on o
saving o
so o
much o
money o
in o
the o
process o
. o

Simon B-PER
Chang I-PER
notes o
that o
a o
major o
innovation o
usually o
is o
nested o
in o
a o
lot o
of o
small o
innovations o
. o

If o
small o
innovations o
are o
not o
recognized o
, o
or o
do o
not o
get o
appropriate o
market o
rewards o
, o
this o
will o
destroy o
the o
motivation o
to o
innovate o
at o
all o
. o

This o
is o
precisely o
the o
problem o
now o
being o
faced o
by o
Comdek B-ORG
, o
the o
first o
company o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
produce o
medical o
instruments o
such o
as o
blood o
- o
oxygen o
monitors o
and o
ear o
thermometers o
. o

Michael B-PER
Y.S. I-PER
Kuo I-PER
, o
general o
manager o
at o
Comdek B-ORG
, o
points o
out o
that o
the o
quick o
and o
easy o
process o
of o
taking o
body o
temperature o
through o
the o
ear o
was o
developed o
by o
an o
American o
company o
, o
and o
the o
German o
giant o
Boehringer-Ingelheim B-ORG
paid o
a o
huge o
amount o
of o
money o
for o
the o
patent o
so o
they o
could o
begin o
production o
. o

Comdek B-ORG
took o
the o
basic o
principle o
, o
and o
went o
to o
work o
on o
it o
, o
eventually o
coming o
up o
with o
their o
own o
version o
, o
for o
which o
they o
have o
been o
awarded o
a o
patent o
. o

But o
when o
Comdek B-ORG
's o
product o
came o
out o
, o
Michael B-PER
Kuo I-PER
still o
found o
himself o
in o
a o
vicious o
struggle o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
pirate o
firms o
: o
" o
It o
's o
equivalent o
to o
making o
fools o
out o
of o
those o
of o
us o
who o
invest o
the o
money o
to o
do o
research o
and o
development o
! o
" o

Kuo B-PER
says o
that o
while o
there o
has o
been o
some o
improvement o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
with o
regard o
to o
protection o
of o
intellectual o
property o
rights o
, o
there o
is o
still o
not o
enough o
for o
those o
who o
invest o
in o
development o
and o
innovation o
. o

Comdek B-ORG
has o
closed o
its o
laboratory o
and o
production o
line o
to o
any o
outside o
visits o
, o
and o
has o
not o
ruled o
out o
the o
possibility o
of o
moving o
its o
lab o
overseas o
to o
get o
away o
from o
industrial o
espionage o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Looking o
for o
a o
Taiwan B-GPE
McDonald B-ORG
's o

Espionage o
reflects o
a o
lack o
of o
respect o
for o
knowledge o
. o

But o
there o
is o
also o
the o
problem o
of o
insufficient o
awareness o
of o
the o
potential o
value o
of o
knowledge o
, o
so o

they o
really o
make o
huge o
profits o
just o
by o

for o
a o

of o

Of o

handling o

of o

What o
Starbucks B-ORG
sells o
is o
not o
coffee o
, o
but o
" o
the o
knowledge o
of o
how o
to o
run o
a o
coffee o
shop o
. o
" o

The o

logic o
applies o
to o

: o

does o
n't o
know o
how o
to o
draw o
their o

It o

to o

to o
have o
a o
bright o
and o
clean o
store o
with o

when o
you o

this o
simple o
product o
together o
with o
a o
trademark o
, o
powerful o
name o
recognition o
, o
and o
high o
quality o
control o
, o
the o
result o
has o
swept o
the o
globe o
. o

Now o
over o
20,000 o
franchises o
worldwide o
work o
to o
expand o
the o
company o

while o
the o
headquarters o
takes o
0.5 o
% o
of o
operating o
revenues o
as o
its o
share o
for o
as o
long o
as o
the o
franchise o
lasts o
. o

In o
recent o
years o
, o
as o
Taiwan B-GPE
firms o
have o
increasingly o
invested o
abroad o
, o
the o
" o
Taiwan B-GPE
experience o
" o
has o
penetrated o
deeply o
into o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
and o
mainland o
China B-GPE
. o

In o
both o
the o
manufacturing o
and o
service o
sectors o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
businessmen o
have o
proven o
adept o
at o
flexibly o
adapting o
to o
local o
society o
. o

But o
now o
that o

methods o
are o

understood o
and o

copied o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
investors o
are o
being o
dropped o
by o
their o

" o
Taiwan B-GPE
companies o
do o

understand o
how o
to o
ensure o
their o
earnings o
from o
management o
knowledge o
and o
company o
name o

, o
and o
are o
not o
in o
the o
habit o
of o

, o
" o
says o
Wu B-PER
with o
regret o
, o
as o
he o
offers o
the o
following o
examples o
: o
Taiwan B-GPE
department o
stores o
are o
a o
cut o
above o
PRC B-GPE
state o
- o
run o
stores o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o

has o
the o
knack o
for o
systematic o
management o
, o
and o
even o
industries o
like o
eel o
- o
raising o
have o
their o
own o
technologies o
and o
operating o
methods o
, o
but o
people o
only o
think o
about o
keeping o
these o
secrets o
to o
themselves o
and o
making o
money o
by o
working o
on o
their o
own o
. o

They o
do o
n't o
know o
how o
to o
spread o
knowledge o
so o
that o
others o
will o
make o
money o
for o
them o
! o

Of o
course o
, o
to o
sell o
operational o
know-how o
, o
this o
knowledge o
must o
be o
converted o
into o
steps o
, o
systems o
, o
and o
standards o
, o
and o
must o
be o
well o
- o
packaged o
. o

And o
trademarks o
and o
patents o
must o
be o
employed o
to o
deter o
potential o
pirates o
. o

Wu B-PER
suggests o
that o
organizations o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
which o
are o
dedicated o
to o
teaching o
management o
methods o
, o
such o
as o
the B-ORG
China I-ORG
Productivity I-ORG
Center I-ORG
, o
should o
assist o
companies o
in o
systematizing o
and o
selling o
the o
rights o
to o
their o
mangement o
and o
operating o
philosophies o
, o
so o
that o
the o
uniquely o
flexible o
Taiwan B-GPE
approach o
to o
business o
can o
be o
reproduced o
and o
marketed o
worldwide o
. o

" o
If o
only o
people o
would o
change o
their o
attitudes o
, o
the o
knowledge o
- o
based o
economy o
could o
have o
many o
new o

every o

Looking o
to o
the o
future o
, o
the o
road o
to o
a o

it o

Teng B-PER
declared o
that o
the o
full o
three o
links o
will o
definitely o
be o

but o
the o
first o
priority o
is o
to o
coordinate o
these o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
WTO B-ORG
entry o
, o
with o
secondary o
attention o
going o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
own o
needs o
. o

Most o
media o
and o
commentators o
have o
been o
positive o
toward o
the o

In o
an o
article o
published o

the B-ORG
United I-ORG

declared o
that o
, o
given o
the o
trend o
of o
economic o
globalization o
, o
the o
opening o
of o
the o
three o
links o
across o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
should o
bring o
unprecedented o
growth o
in o
cross-strait o
economic o
ties o
. o

In o
addition o
, o
promoting o
economic o
links o
is o
something o
that o
both o
sides o
find o
acceptable o
despite o
the o
frigid o
nature o
of o
the o
political o
relationship o
. o

As o
the o
borderless o
global o
economy o
takes o
shape o
in o
the o
21st o
century o
, o
the o
three o
links o
will o
help o
businesses o
expand o
their o
economic o
space o
and o
encourage o
industrial o
upgrading o
, o
with o
both o
sides o
benefiting o
. o

But o
PRC B-GPE
economic o
experts o
note o
that o
, o
once o
both o
sides o
enter o
the o
WTO B-ORG
, o
the o
mainland o
's o
large o
market o
will o
be o
contested o
by o
firms o
from o
all o
over o
the o
world o

They o
say o
that o
the o
transfer o
of o
high o
technology o
firms o
from o

to o
the o
PRC B-GPE
will o
aid o
in o
construction o
of o
a o

would o

On o

, o
in o

of o

, o
in o

Taiwan B-GPE
expects o
to o
implement o
a o
new o
policy o
allowing o

This o
could o

At o

the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
passed o
a o
draft o
amendment o
to o
the o
Public o
Officials o
Election o
and o
Recall o
Law o
, o
tightening o
the o
criteria o
for o
those o
seeking o
public o
office o
so o
as o
to o
prevent o
mob o
affiliates o
from o
securing o
legal o
immunity o
as o
elected o
representatives o
. o

Under o
the o
new o
provisions o
, o
anyone o
convicted o
and o
sentenced o
to o
jail o
under o
the o
Organized o
Crime o
Statute o
is o
barred o
for o
life o
from o
seeking o

to o
an o
official o

, o
while o
those o
indicted o
for o
a o
capital o
offence o
or o
for o
crimes o
carrying o
sentences o
of o
ten o
years o
or o
more o
are o
barred o
pending o
the o
verdict o
of o
the o
court o
. o

Political o
parties o
become o
liable o
for o

if o
they o
nominate o

who o
have o
prior o
convictions o
for o
electoral o
fraud o
or o

These o
revisions o
to o

The o
new o
provisions o
have o
received o
cross-party o
support o
in o
the o

, o
though o
some o
deputies o
want o
further o
consultation o
concerning o
the o

of o
those o

with o
but o
not o
yet o
convicted o
of o

, o
secretary o

general o
of o
the o

caucus o
in o
the o

, o
says o
that o
the o
party o
supports o
barring o
those o
convicted o
of o
involvement o
in o
organized o
crime o
from o
public o
office o
, o
but o
feels o
that o
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
needs o
to o
clarify o
just o
what o
" o
involvement o
" o
constitutes o
in o
this o
context o
. o

Also o
, o
at o
the o
end o
of o
December o
and o
after o
much o
consultation o
within o
the o
opposition o
alliance o
, o
a o
preliminary o
agreement o
was o
reached o
on o
the o
draft o
amendment o
to o
the o
Farmers o
' o
and o
Fishermen o
's o
Associations o
Law o
, o
which o
has o
been o
under o
lengthy o
review o
in o
the o
legislature o
. o

According o
to o
the o
agreement o
, o
restrictions o
on o
those o
seeking o
association o
membership o
and o
sub-committee o
posts o
will o
be o
relaxed o
, o
but o
the o
rules o
will o
be o
tightened o
for o
those o
running o
for o
the o
posts o
of o
director o
or o
general o
secretary o
, o
excluding o
or o
removing o
from o
office o
anyone o
who o
is o
in o
default o
for o
more o
than o
a o
year o
on o
loans o
from o
these o
and o
other o
such o
financial o
organizations o
. o

However o
, o
the o
amendment o
remains o
stuck o
in o
the o
legislative o
queue o
for o
the o
time o
being o
. o

In o

to o
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG

the B-ORG

also o
scored o
some o
successes o
in o
the o
past o
few o
months o
in o
its o
campaign o
against o

In o

, o
was o

in o
the o
transit o
lounge o
at o
Macau o

and o
brought o
back o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o

. o

Yang B-PER
had o
fled o
to o
the o
mainland o
in o
November o
1997 o
, o
after o
a o
warrant o
was o
issued o
for o
his o
arrest o
in o
connection o
with o
a o
loan o
- o
shark o
operation o
, o
and o
has o
been o
a o
key o
target o
for o
the o
police o
ever o
since o
. o

Good o
news o
has o
also o
been o
coming o
in o
from o
local o
prosecutors o
' o
offices o
around o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Prosecutors o
in o
Taitung B-GPE
have o
been o
investigating o
county o
councilors o
for o
alleged o
corruption o
involving o
public o
grants o
and o
construction o
projects o
, o
and o
after o
half o
a o
year o
of o
the o
investigation o
19 o
representatives o
have o
been o
indicted o
, o
including o
the o
current o
speaker o

deputy o
speaker o
of o
the o

council o
, o
along o
with o
41 o
members o
of o
the o
previous o
two o
sessions o
of o
the o

. o

This o
sets o
a o
judicial o
record o
for o
the o
number o
of o
elected o
representatives o
facing o
charges o
in o
a o
single o
case o
. o

Meanwhile o
, o
prosecutors o
in o
Changhua B-GPE
have o
been o
investigating o
electoral o
fraud o
from o
the o
time o
of o
the o
presidential o
election o
, o
and o
are o
seeking o
sentences o
of o
two o
months o
to o
three o
years o
for o
over o
200 o
people o
, o
including o
the o
head o
of o

, o
for o
breaking o
the o

The B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG

has o
achieved o
a o
measure o
of o
success o
so o
far o
in o
its o
crackdown o
on o
black o
gold o
, o
but o
in o
order o
to o
win o
public o
support o
it o
has o
had o
to o
stress o
to o
investigators o
the o
need o
to o
observe o
due o
process o
and o
respect o
suspects o
' o
rights o
. o

The o
ministry o
has o
also o
required o
prosecutors o
to o
use o

when o
collecting o
evidence o
about o

for o
which o
there o

a o
leading o

on o

Taiwan B-GPE
art o
scene o
back o
in o
the o
1950s o
, o
as o

" o
Eight o

who o
launched o
the o
island o

Since o
then o
his o

has o
taken o
him o
around o
the o
world o
, o
and o
he o
has o
at o
last o
ended o
up o
back o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

What o
is o
it o
that o
distinguishes o
Hsia B-PER
's o
work o
and o
that o
marked o
him o
out o
for o
the o
National o

and o
what o
kind o
of o
contribution o
has o

Hsia B-PER
Tzu I-PER
- I-PER
hsiang I-PER
, o
as o
he o
was o
then o
named o
, o
was o
born o
into o
a o
literary o
family o
in o
Hunan B-GPE
Province I-GPE
. o

Fate o
robbed o
him o
of o
his o
mother o
within o
a o
week o
of o
his o
birth o
, o
and o
of o
his o
father o
when o
he o
was o
just o
four o
. o

His o
grandmother o
took o
him o
to o
Sichuan B-GPE
to o
escape o
the o
war o
, o
and o
they o
returned o
a o
couple o
of o
years o
later o
to o
find o
the o
family o
home o
in o
ruins o
. o

When o
he o
was o
nine o
his o
grandmother o
died o
and o
he o
was o
entrusted o
to o
a o
great o
aunt o
. o

She o
in o
turn o
died o
when o
Hsia B-PER
was o
13 o
, o
after o
which o
he o
went o
to o
live o
with o
an o
uncle o
and o
aunt o
in o
Hankou B-PER
. o

They o
wanted o
to o
send o
him o
to o
join o
his o
elder o
brother o
in o
Changsha B-GPE
, o
but o
his o
brother o
did o
n't o
have o
the o
means o
to o
take o
care o
of o
him o
either o
. o

At o
the o
age o
of o
16 o
, o
after o
years o
of o
being o
passed o
from o
pillar o
to o
post o
, o
Hsia B-PER
joined o
the o
army o
- o
where o
at o
least o
he o
knew o
that o
he o
'd o
get o
fed o
. o

" o
It o
was o
a o
big o
clan o
, o
and o
it o
just o
fell o
apart o
! o
" o
says o
Hsia B-PER
with o
a o
rueful o
smile o
, o
the o
expression o
of o
one o
who o
has o
seen o
life o
and o
holds o
few o
illusions o
. o

Hsia B-PER
joined o
up o
in o
the o
year o
that o
the o
Nationalist o
forces o
retreated o
from o

and o
soon o
found o
himself o
in o
a o
desk o
job o
at o
Air B-ORG

General I-ORG
HQ I-ORG
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

By o
coincidence o
, o
the o
dormitory o
bunk o
above o
his o
was o
occupied o
by o
another o
aspiring o
painter o
, o
Wu B-PER
Hao I-PER
. o

The o
two o
became o
firm o

and o
began o
to o

under o
Li B-PER
Chung I-PER
- I-PER

, o
the o

of o

At o
Li B-PER
's o

they o
teamed o
up o
with o
a o

of o

the o
" o
Eight o
Great o
Outlaws o
" o
of o
Taiwanese o
modern o
art o
. o

As o
Hsia B-PER
recalls o
, o
the o
main o
incentive o
for o
studying o
under o
Li B-PER
Chung I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
was o
that o
Li B-PER
's o
fees o
were o
relatively o
affordable o
. o

Other o
painters o
charged o
upwards o
of o
45 o
yuan o
per o
month o
, o
with o
fees o
at o
studios o
run o
by o
older o
, o
more o
established o
Taiwanese o
artists o
reaching o
60 o
or o
70 o
yuan o
. o

No o
amount o
of o
scrimping o
and o
saving o
was o
going o
to o
put o
that o
within o
reach o
of o
someone o
like o
Hsia B-PER
, o
getting o
by o
on o
a o
military o
allowance o
of o
just o
25 o
yuan o
per o
month o
. o

The o
only o
choice o
was o
the o
Antung o
Street o
Studio o
, o
where o
the o
monthly o
fee o
was o
just o
20 o
yuan o
. o

Rescuing o
Chinese o
art o

The o
economic o
constraints o
and o
repressive o
censorship o
of o
the o
era o
did o
nothing o
to o
deter o
these o
young o
art o
fiends o
. o

As o
Hsia B-PER
recalls o
, o
the o
only o
art o
materials o
they o
could o
get o
hold o
of o
were o
red o
and o
black o
ink o
, o
courtesy o
of o
the o
military o
, o
and o
pencils o
. o

Sometimes o
they o
mixed o
the o
ink o
with o
glue o
to o
produce o
an o
oil o
- o
paint o
texture o
. o

Scraping o
together o
the o
money o
for o
just o
one o
tube o
of o
oil o
paint o
involved o
considerable o
effort o
, o
and o
Hsia B-PER
remembers o
repeatedly o
uncapping o
that o
single o
tube o
to o
breathe o
in o
the o
lovely o
scent o
of o
linseed o
oil o
. o

The o
painters o
took o
turns o
taking o
off o
their o
shirts o
to o
model o
for o
each o
other o
, o
and o
Hsia B-PER
would o
sometimes o
spend o
the o
whole o
day o
sketching o
customers o
at o
the o
ice o
- o
cream o
shop o
by o
the o
train o
station o
, o
after o
paying o
for o
a o
single o
slice o
of o
watermelon o
. o

In o
1955 o
, o
against o
the o
advice o
of o
their o
teacher o
and o
clueless o
about o
the o
risks o
involved o
in o
starting o
up o
a o
new o
organization o
-LRB- o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
under o
martial o
law o
at o
the o
time o
-RRB- o
, o
the o
young o
artists o
formed o
themselves o
into o
the B-ORG
Ton I-ORG
- I-ORG
Fan I-ORG
Group I-ORG
. o

People o
flocked o
to o
buy o
tickets o
for o
the o
exhibition o
that o
they o
mounted o
at o
a o
venue o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
's o
Chunghua o
Road o
, o
but o
many o
visitors o
found o
that o
the o
art o
was o
not o
to o
their o
liking o
. o

Some o
, o
feeling o
" o
cheated o
, o
" o
flung o
their o
exhibition o
leaflets o
on o
the o
floor o
in o
disgust o
. o

" o
They o
cost o
50 o
cents o
each o
to o
produce o
! o
" o
exclaims o
Hsia B-PER
, o
still o
bemoaning o
the o
waste o
. o

Raising o
the o
banner o
of o
reform o
, o
the o
Outlaws o
issued o
a o
declaration o
forecasting o
Chinese o
art o
's o
inevitable o
decline o
if o
it o
stayed o
stuck o
in o
the o
past o
. o

Only o
through o
the o
introduction o
of o
modern o
forms o
of o
expression o
from o
the o
outside o
world o
, o
they o
said o
, o
could o
the o
boundless o
resources o
of o
China B-GPE
's o
art o
tradition o
be o
revitalized o
. o

The o
declaration o
, o
which o
Hsia B-PER
drafted o
, o
shows o
that o
the o
group o
's o
objective o
was o
to o
modernize o
Chinese o
art o
by o
drawing o
Western o
artistic o
concepts o
and o
methods o
into o
the o
production o
of o
essentially o
Chinese o
works o
. o

This o
insistence o
on o
the o
" o
China B-GPE
" o
element o
has o
been o
a o
hallmark o
of o
Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
's I-PER
art o
ever o
since o
. o

Outlaws o
around o
the o
world o

From o
paintings o
of o
his o
done o
during o
that o
early o
period o
, o
one o
sees o
how o
Hsia B-PER
rendered o
human o
figures o
using o
the o
thick o
lines o
of o
traditional o
Chinese o
folk o
painting o
, o
but o
proceeded o
to o
dissect o
and o
reassemble o
those o
figures o
in o
a o
Western o
, o
mechanistic o
fashion o
. o

In o
his o
painting o
Flying o
Apsaras o
, o
Hsia B-PER
brings o
a o
modern o
geometrical o
approach o
to o
the o
traditional o
image o
of o
airborne o
Buddhist o
spirits o
. o

Critic o
Wang B-PER
Chia I-PER
- I-PER
chi I-PER
describes o
these o
divine o
beings o
shown o
wafting o
through o
a o
void o
of o
blank o
space o
as o
" o
kind o
of o
surreal o
. o
. o
. o
like o
astronauts o
in o
a o
state o
of o
weightlessness o
. o
" o

Hsia B-PER
has o
also o
produced o
a o
number o
of o
purely o
abstract o
works o
, o
drawing o
on o
his o
deep o
familiarity o
with o
that o
most o
important o
element o
of o
Chinese o
art o
- o
the o
use o
of o
line o
. o

In o
1955 o
Hsiao B-PER
Chin I-PER
went o
to o
study o
in o
Spain B-GPE
, o
becoming o
the o
first o
of o
the B-ORG
Ton I-ORG
- I-ORG
Fan I-ORG
Group I-ORG
to o
go o
overseas o
. o

He o
wrote o
back o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
describing o
the o
new o
trends o
in o
art o
that o
he o
was o
witness o
to o
, o
and o
the o
other o
painters o
, o
after o
poring o
over o
the o
contents o
of o
his o
densely o
written o
airmail o
letters o
, o
began o
putting o
some o
of o
those o
ideas o
into o
practice o
. o

Taiwan B-GPE
was o
very o
cut o
off o
from o
the o
world o
in o
those o
days o
, o
and o
those o
studying o
art o
naturally o
wanted o
to o
see o
for o
themselves o
what o
was o
happening o
elsewhere o
. o

In o
their o
letters o
to o
Hsiao B-PER
, o
all o
the o
others o
, o
including o
their o
teacher o
Li B-PER
Chung I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
, o
asked o
about o
the o
cost o
of o
living o
overseas o
. o

One o
by o
one o
, o
each o
member o
of o
the o
group o
set o
off o
on o
his o
own o
modern o
art o
pilgrimage o
to o
the o
West B-LOC

Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
, o
for o
whom o
France B-GPE
was o
the o
art o
center o
of o
the o
world o
, o
made o
his o
move o
in o
1963 o
, o
traveling o
by o
ship o
from o
Keelung B-GPE
to o
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
and o
from o
there o
on o
to o
Europe B-LOC
. o

The o
cost o
of o
his o
one o

way o
ticket o
was o
borne o
by o
his o
colleague o
at o
Air B-ORG

Chang B-PER
Chuan I-PER

jen I-PER
, o
who o
generously o
put o
his o
entire o
savings o
of o
NT$ o
5,000 o
at o
Hsia B-PER
's o
disposal o
. o

On o
the o
way o
to o
France B-GPE
Hsia B-PER
stopped o
off o
in o
Milan B-GPE
to o
visit o
Hsiao B-PER
Chin I-PER
. o

Hsia B-PER
remembers o
that o
Hsiao B-PER
's o
first o
words o
on o
meeting o
were o
: o
" o
Come o
on o
, o
let o
's o
paint o
. o
" o

For o
someone o
like o
Hsia B-PER
, o
orphaned o
early o
and o
shunted o
for o
years o
among o
various o
relatives o
, o
the o
support o
and o
affection o
of o
his o
friends o
has o
played o
a o
particularly o
important o
part o
in o
his o
life o
. o

Fuzzy o
people o
, o
floating o
people o

During o
his o
four o
- o
and o
- o
a o
- o
half o
years o
in o
Paris B-GPE
Hsia B-PER
lived o
in o
a o
tiny o
garret o
in o
the o
red o
light o
district o
with o
barely o
enough o
room o
to o
stand o
up o
in o
. o

He o
supported o
himself o
doing o
miscellaneous o
jobs o
, o
working o
on o
people o
's o
houses o
and o
restoring o
furniture o
. o

Times o
were o
tough o
, o
but o
it o
was o
during o
this o
period o
that o
he o
found o
what o
he o
had o
been o
probing o
for o
in o
his o
use o
of o
line o
, o
and o
started o
on o
the o
" o
fuzzy o
people o
" o
phase o
of o
his o
output o
. o

Hsia B-PER
's o
fuzzy o
people o
were o
born o
into o
his o
work o
as o
if o
by o
a o
natural o
process o
. o

While o
experimenting o
with o
a o
tangle o
of o
lines o
Hsia B-PER
found o
unidentifiable o
clusters o
taking o
shape o
, o
from o
which o
human o
forms o
began o
to o
emerge o
. o

" o
This o
was o
something o
I o
really o
knew o
I o
could o
work o
with o
, o
" o
recalls o
Hsia B-PER
. o

It o
was o
a o
case o
of o
" o
seizing o
that o
special o
thing o
of o
your o
own o
, o
" o
which o
for o
an o
artist o
is o
of o
the o
utmost o
importance o
. o

Like o
a o
Taoist o
priest o
painting o
magic o
symbols o
, o
Hsia B-PER
uses o
line o
to o
create o
human o
figures o
and o
the o
written o
word o
to o
invoke o
power o
. o

With o
rapid o
, o
sweeping o
strokes o
of o
the o
brush o
he o
creates o
fluid o
, o
free o
- o
floating o
figures o
, o
without o
faces o
or o
personalities o
, o
performing o
their o
allotted o
roles o
in o
the o
midst o
of o
a o
coldly o
linear o
realm o
. o

The o
resulting o
images o
reflect o
the o
alienation o
of o
modern o
life o
, o
conveying o
a o
sense o
of o
illusion o
and o
impermanence o
. o

It o
has o
been o
suggested o
that o
Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
himself o
, o
the o
lifelong o
drifter o
, o
is o
the o
prototype o
for o
these o
blurry o
beings o
. o

But o
then o
again o
, o
which o
of o
us o
is o
not o
in o
transit o
, o
drifting o
through o
this o
brief o
existence o
? o

" o
As o
the o
Chinese o
say o
, o
man o
is o
a o
passenger o
through o
life o
who o
is o
gone o
in o
an o
instant o
. o

Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
's I-PER
fuzzy o
people o
exist o
very o
much o
within o
this o
Eastern o
philosophical o
context o
. o
" o

So o
says o
Fu B-PER
Shen I-PER
, o
one o
of o
the o
judges o
in o
the o
fine o
arts o
category o
for o
the o
2000 o
National B-ORG
Culture I-ORG
and I-ORG
Arts I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
awards o
. o

While o
he o
was o
in o
France B-GPE
Hsia B-PER
received o
a o
letter o
from o
a o
friend o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
saying o
: o
" o
Life o
is o
easier o
here o
. o
" o

Soon o
afterwards o
he o
moved o
to o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, o
renting o
a o
cheap o
loft o
in o
SoHo B-LOC
and o
supporting o
himself o
as o
a o
furniture o
restorer o
. o

Photorealism o
was o
the o
vogue o
in o
American o
painting o
at o
the o
time o
. o

It o
did o
n't o
appeal o
to o
Hsia B-PER
at o
first o
, o
but o
he o
knew o
he o
had o
to o
learn o
something o
in o
his o
new o
country o
of o
residence o
, o
and o
at o
the o
same o
time o
he o
needed o
to o
produce o
work o
that o
was o
commercially o
viable o
. o

He o
began o
employing o
photographic o
effects o
, o
for o
example o
depicting o
a o
crowd o
of o
passersby o
on o
a o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
street o
as o
a o
speeding o
blur o
. o

His o
work o
now o
became o
populated o
with o
" o
floating o
people o
" o
of o
this o
kind o
, o
although o
in o
spirit o
they o
were o
still o
the o
fuzzy o
people o
of o
his o
earlier o
period o
. o

Hsia B-PER
spent o
over o
20 o
years o
in o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, o
painting o
in o
the o
cavernous o
gloom o
of o
his o
loft o
, o
eating o
Chinese o
food o
and o
listening o
to o
traditional o
Chinese o
opera o
music o
. o

The o
walls o
of o
the o
loft o
were o
pasted o
with o
simple o
verses o
, o
written o
by o
Hsia B-PER
in o
language o
that o
was o
part o
literary o
Chinese o
and o
part o
colloquial o
. o

" o
I o
was o
like o
a o
Chinese o
person o
dwelling o
in o
a o
Chinese o
concession o
in o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, o
" o
says o
Hsia B-PER
with o
a o
laugh o
. o

The o
biggest o
boon o
of o
living o
in o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
was o
that o
this o
was o
where o
Hsia B-PER
met o
his o
wife o
Wu B-PER
Shuang I-PER
- I-PER
hsi I-PER
. o

Wu B-PER
had o
grown o
up o
in o
a o
contented o
home o
never o
knowing o
poverty o
, o
and o
held o
a o
PhD o
in o
philosophy o
. o

She o
met o
Hsia B-PER
through o
the o
painter o
Hsieh B-PER
Li I-PER
- I-PER
fa I-PER
, o
and o
since o
then o
the o
two o
of o
them o
have o
shared o
a o
simple o
and o
quiet o
life o
together o
. o

" o
Feeling o
anxious o
when o
the o
old o
lady o
's o
not o
here o
, o
and o
looking o
listlessly o
out o
the o
window o
/ o
So o
bored o
of o
this o
dumb o
view o
, o
it o
's o
much o
better o
when o
the o
silly o
little o
thing o
's o
around o
. o
" o

So o
runs o
one o
of o
Hsia B-PER
's o
light o
- o
hearted o
couplets o
, o
testifying o
to o
the o
affection o
that o
unites o
these o
two o
people o
who o
only o
came o
together o
relatively o
late o
in o
life o
. o

Going o
home o

Hsia B-PER
returned o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
1992 o
, o
after o
three o
decades o
away o
. o

With o
a o
basic o
source o
of o
income o
guaranteed o
through o
an o
art o
- o
gallery o
contract o
, o
Hsia B-PER
rented o
a o
spacious o
, o
light o
- o
filled o
three o
- o
story o
house o
in o
Peitou B-GPE
. o

The o
new o
place o
was o
ideal o
for o
painting o
, o
but o
at o
NT$ o
35,000 o
per o
month o
the o
rent o
was o
on o
the o
high o
side o
. o

Hsia B-PER
's o
" o
silly o
little o
" o
wife o
was o
in o
tears o
when o
it o
came o
to o
signing o
the o
lease o
, o
worrying o
that o
eventually o
they o
would o
n't o
be o
able o
to o
afford o
the o
rent o
. o

Luckily o
Professor o
Li B-PER
Chih I-PER
- I-PER
wen I-PER
of o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Arts I-ORG
offered o
to o
support o
them o
to o
the o
tune o
of o
NT$ o
10,000 o
per o
month o
for o
the o
first o
three o
years o
after o
their o
return o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
Hsia B-PER
and o
his o
wife o
were o
thus o
able o
to o
settle o
themselves o
down o
. o

" o
At o
key o
moments o
, o
a o
little o
help o
from o
your o
friends o
can o
make o
all o
the o
difference o
, o
" o
says o
Hsia B-PER
. o

Financial o
help o
from o
his o
friends o
at o
such o
moments o
was o
what o
enabled o
Hsia B-PER
to o
go o
abroad o
in o
the o
first o
place o
and o
then o
, o
eventually o
, o
to o
return o
again o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

This o
is o
something o
that o
the o
reserved o
Hsia B-PER
has o
frequent o
cause o
to o
think o
about o
. o

After o
returning o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
reverted o
to o
painting o
fuzzy o
people o
. o

Over o
the o
years o
, o
Hsia B-PER
's o
fuzzy o
people o
have o
taken o
on o
a o
number o
of o
different o
guises o
, o
be o
it o
as o
judges o
, o
singers o
, o
couples o
, o
beach o
babes o
or o
whatever o
. o

They o
have o
mimicked o
famous o
icons o
of o
Western o
art o
such o
as o
the o
Mona o
Lisa o
, o
Millet B-PER
's o
The o
Gleaners o
, o
and o
Botticelli B-PER
's o
Venus o
, o
and o
now o
the o
fuzzy o
family o
includes o
well o
- o
known o
figures o
from o
the o
Chinese o
Buddhist o
pantheon o
, o
part o
of o
a o
series o
of o
works o
that o
examines o
the o
role o
of o
religion o
in o
people o
's o
lives o
. o

For o
Hsia B-PER
Yang I-PER
, o
all o
characters o
are o
fair o
game o
for o
inclusion o
in o
his o
work o
, o
and o
all o
of o
them o
end o
up o
reverting o
to o
nothingness o
. o

Fuzzy o

Why o
is o
Hsia B-PER
so o
into o
" o
fuzzy o
people o
, o
" o
and o
has o
he o
ever o
thought o
about o
trying o
something o
else o
? o

The o
painter o
points o
out o
that o
he o
ca o
n't o
predict o
what o
direction o
he o
may o
follow o
in o
the o
future o
, o
and o
says o
that o
if o
a o
new o
theme o
or o
style o
emerges o
it o
will o
be o
through o
a o
natural o
process o
, o
like o
the o
one o
that o
first o
gave o
birth o
to o
the o
fuzzy o
people o
. o

At o
the o
end o
of o
2000 o
Hsia B-PER
's o
fuzzy o
people o
at o
last o
" o

up o
" o
for o
themselves o
, o
becoming o
sculptures o
rather o
than o
just o
images o
on o

Hsia B-PER
was o
fiddling o
with o
an o
aluminum o
ring o
from o
a o
broken o
hair o
- o
dryer o
, o
shaping o
it o
into o
a o
little o
figure o
, o
when o
the o
idea o
dawned o
of o
doing o
fuzzy o
people o
in o
solid o
form o
. o

By o
cutting o
and o
twisting o
pieces o
of o
copper o
, o
iron o
and o
steel o
, o
he o
was o
able o
to o
produce o
amusing o
little o
statuettes o
of o
his o
hitherto o
two o
- o
dimensional o
fuzzy o
people o
. o

Hsia B-PER
's o
friends o
were o
not o
surprised o
by o
his o
move o
into o
sculpture o
, o
because o
he o
has o
always o
been o
good o
with o
his o
hands o
. o

In o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
he o
once o
made o
a o
hand o
- o
operated o
washing o
machine o
from o
a o
saucepan o
and o
several o
pieces o
of o
wood o
, o
and o
on o
another o
occasion o
he o
used o
the o
motor o
from o
an o
electric o
fan o
to o
power o
a o
self o
- o
adjusting o

In o

I o
wonder o
if o

of o

Tianding I-PER
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
Robin B-PER
Hood I-PER
, o
fleeing o
from o

Countless o
legends o
grew o
up o
around o
Liao B-PER
after o
his o
death o
, o
and o
the o
people o
of o
Pali B-GPE
began o
to o
worship o
his o
spirit o
. o

In o
1958 o
, o
his o
small o
burial o
plot o
was o
converted o
into o
a o
huge o
temple o
. o

He o
has o
followers o
scattered o
far o
and o
wide o
, o
and o
every o
year o
on o
the o
special o
day o
appointed o
for o

and o

The o
Ko B-PER
brothers o
, o
now o
in o
their o
60s o
, o
recall o
their o
impressions o
of o
a o
visit o
to o
the o
Liao B-PER
Tianding I-PER
gravesite o
: o
" o
It o
must o
have o
been o
30 o
years o
ago o
, o
we o
used o
to o
go o
there o
just o
for o
the o
fun o
of o
it o
. o

The o
road o
in o
front o
of o
the o
temple o
was o
n't o
so o
wide o
then o
, o
and o
what o
a o
crowd o
! o

People o
were o
so o
jammed o
in o
you o
could o
n't o
move o
. o
" o

They o
also o
recall o
that o
the o
Pali B-GPE
of o
those o
days o
was o
a o
place o
in o
which o
most o
people o
lived o
by o
fishing o
, o
farming o
, o
or o
petty o
trading o
. o

The o
elder o
Ko B-PER
gives o
a o
thumbs o
- o
up o
and o
declares o
: o
" o
That o
's o
why o
I o
always o
say o
that o
a o
can o
- o
do o
guy o
like o
Liao B-PER
Tianding I-PER
must o
be o
looking o
after o
us o
, o
so o
that o
we o
have o
developed o
and o
can o
even o
earn o
money o
from o
the o
tourists o
. o
" o

Yet o
, o
he o
may o
not o
know o
about o
Pali B-GPE
's o
real o
heyday o
, o
long o
in o
the o
past o
. o

The o
days o
of o
the o
sailing o
ships o

Pali B-GPE
was o
originally o
called o
Palifen B-GPE
, o
a o
transliteration o
of o
the o
place o
name o
used o
by o
the o
Ketagalan o
indigenous o
people o
. o

Located o
on o
the o
northwest o
corner o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
Pali B-GPE
faces o
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
to o
the o
northwest o
, o
rests o
against o
Mt. B-LOC
Kuanyin I-LOC
to o
the o
southeast o
, o
and o
looks o
across o
the o
river o
toward o
Tanshui B-GPE
to o
the o
northeast o
. o

Though o
it o
does o
n't o
have o
much o
of o
a o
hinterland o
, o
its o
geographic o
location o
has o
proved o
historically o
important o
, o
as o
one o
can o
see o
from o
the o
prehistoric o
cultures o
unearthed o
at o
the o
Ta B-LOC
- I-LOC
pen I-LOC
- I-LOC
keng I-LOC
and o
Shih B-LOC
- I-LOC
san I-LOC
- I-LOC
hang I-LOC
archeological o
sites o
. o

Later o
, o
when o
Han o
Chinese o
began o
trickling o
across o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
they o
mainly o
settled o
along o
rivers o
. o

Because o
Pali B-GPE
is o
relatively o
close o
to o
the o
mainland o
and o
sits o
at o
the o
mouth o
of o
a o
river o
, o
despite o
the o
fact o
that o
it o
does o
not o
have o
a o
natural o
harbor o
, o
in o
1757 o
the o
Qing o
court o
designated o
it o
to o
be o
one o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
small o
number o
of o
official o
ports o
for o
maritime o
transport o
with o
the o
mainland o
. o

Thus o
began o
an o
era o
in o
which o
great o
ships o
sailed o
in o
and o
out o
of o
Pali B-GPE
. o

However o
, o
as o
a o
result o
of o
silting o
and o
a o
destructive o
typhoon o
that o
struck o
in o
1796 o
, o
Pali B-GPE
began o
to o
give o
way o
in o
importance o
to o
Tanshui B-GPE
, o
located o
just o
across o
the o
river o
. o

Once o
mainly o
dependent o
on o
fishing o
, o
Pali B-GPE
increasingly o
came o
to o
rely o
on o
farming o
. o

But o
the o
hilly o
terrain o
and o
strong o
winds o
meant o
that o
there o
was o
little o
good o
land o
. o

While o
the o
hardy o
people o
of o
Pali B-GPE
barely o
kept o
their o
stomachs o
filled o
, o
their o
children o
and o
grandchildren o
left o
in o
search o
of o
a o
better o
life o
. o

Neither o
the o
Japanese o
occupation o
-LRB- o
which o
began o
in o
1895 o
-RRB- o
nor o
the o
return o
to o
Chinese o
rule o
-LRB- o
in o
1945 o
-RRB- o
brought o
much o
joy o
or o
change o
to o
this o
rural o
area o
. o

But o
in o
the o
1970s o
, o
urban o
planning o
came o
to o
Pali B-GPE
. o

It o
proved o
to o
be o
the o
prelude o
to o
a o
symphony o
-LRB- o
or o
perhaps o
cacophony o
-RRB- o
of o
transformation o
. o

Changing o
the o
rhythm o
of o
Pali B-GPE
life o

During o
the o
height o
of o
real o
estate o
speculation o
and o
soaring o
land o
prices o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
, o
builders o
put o
up o
self o
- o
described o
" o
villas o
" o
and o
" o
mansions o
" o
-LRB- o
apartment o
blocks o
, o
in o
fact o
-RRB- o
one o
after o
another o
in o
Pali B-GPE
. o

Also o
, o
to o
try o
to o
reduce o
the o
outflow o
of o
population o
from o
Pali B-GPE
and o
to o
get o
the o
stagnant o
local o
economy o
moving o
, o
the o
government o
decided o
to o
link o
this o
formerly o
isolated o
village o
to o
the o
outside o
world o
. o

What o
had o
been o
Chungshan o
Road o
was o
turned o
into o
Provincial o
Highway o
#15 o
, o
and o
the o
opening o
of o
the o
Kuantu o
Bridge o
to o
traffic o
linked o
Pali B-GPE
directly o
to o
the o
busy o
Taipei B-GPE
districts o
of o
Shilin B-GPE
and o
Peitou B-GPE
. o

Gifted o
with o
a o
lovely o
setting o
between o
the o
mountains o
and o
the o
sea o
, o
Pali B-GPE
began o
to o
dream o
of o
a o
tourism o
boom o
. o

But o
fortune o
had o
other o
things o
in o
store o
. o

In o
order o
to o
pave o
the o
way o
for o
the o
construction o
of o
a o
water o
treatment o
facility o
on o
the o
northeast o
edge o
of o
Pali B-GPE
, o
the o
plan o
to o
develop o
tourism o
in o
Pali B-GPE
was o
scrapped o
overnight o
. o

The o
government o
, o
applying o
urban o
planning o
principles o
, o
zoned o
the o
area o
for o
residential o
and o
industrial o
use o
, o
in o
order o
to o
create o
a o
construction o
site o
for o
the o
facility o
. o

Then o
in o
1987 o
came o
the o
program o
to o
bring o
gravel o
from o
eastern o
to o
western o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o
construction o
purposes o
, o
and o
a o
harbor o
was o
built o
on o
the o
Pali B-GPE
coast o
for o
the o
convenience o
of o
gravel o
transporters o
. o

In o
accordance o
with o
the o
urban o
plan o
, o
new o
streets o
were o
cut o
this o
way o
and o
that o
through o
Pali B-GPE
's o
land o
, o
and o
high o
- o
rise o
buildings o
sprang o
up o
along o
the o
sides o
of o
these o
roadways o
. o

The o
sounds o
of o
backhoes o
at o
work o
resounded o
even o
from o
the o
black o
sand o
beaches o
. o

In o
1997 o
, o
the o
Hsiachuotzu B-GPE
garbage o
landfill o
formally o
opened o
, o
and o
it o
became o
common o
to o
see o
fleets o
of o
garbage o
trucks o
winding o
through o
the o
streets o
of o
Pali B-GPE
. o

This o
rural o
township o
, o
which o
was o
made o
responsible o
for o
storing o
the o
garbage o
from o
several o
communities o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
seemed o
resigned o
to o
the o
fate o
-LRB- o
suffered o
by o
many o
outlying o
areas o
-RRB- o
of o
having o
to o
choke o
on o
the o
garbage o
spit o
up o
by o
others o
. o

It o
is o
only o
recently o
that o
the o
residents o
of o
Hsiachuotsu B-GPE
, o
unable o
to o
stand o
the o
smell o
, o
have o
begun o

the o
roof o
of o
his o
house o
and o
looks o
across o
to o
the o
beach o
where o
he o
used o
to o
run o
and o
play o
as o
a o
child o
. o

He o
can o
not o
help o
but o
sigh o
, o
as o
he o
looks o
at o
the o
ranks o
of o
new o
buildings o
and o
thinks o
of o
the o
dramatic o
changes o
that o
have o
come o
to o
this o
area o
: o
" o
These o
construction o
projects o
have o
destroyed o
the o
relationship o
we o
people o
of o
Pali B-GPE
used o
to o
have o
with o
the o
sea o
. o
" o

It o
's o
certainly o
true o
that o
a o
lot o
of o
people o
here o
thought o
they o
would o
get o
rich o
from o
the o
rezoning o
. o

But o
just o
because o
land o
increases o
in o
value o
does o
n't o
mean o
someone o
will o
buy o
it o
, o
and o
just o
because o
apartment o
complexes o
are o
built o
does o
n't o
mean o
there o
are o
people o
who o
want o
to o
live o
there o
. o

Worst o
of o
all o
, o
interpersonal o
relationships o
have o
been o
poisoned o
in o
the o
struggle o
over o
divvying o
up o
the o
profits o
, o
because o
no o
one o
really o
knows o
how o
much o
money o
is o
involved o
. o

Lin B-PER
concludes o
: o
" o
I o
am o
not o
by o
any o
means o
opposed o
to o
development o
. o

But o
development o
is o
not o
necessarily o
the o
same o
as o
progress o
. o

Can o
the o
people o
of o
Pali B-GPE
really o
survive o
change o
of o
this o
magnitude o
? o
" o

All o
part o
of o
the o
plan o
? o

One o
after o
another o
, o
government o
development o
plans o
have o
raised o
the o
expectations o
of o
Pali B-GPE
residents o
. o

But o
so o
far o
the o
only o
things o
Pali B-GPE
folk o
have o
been o
able o
to o
enjoy o
have o
been o
flying o
dust o
from o
construction o
sites o
, o
roads o
filled o
with o
giant o
trucks o
, o
and o
new o
neighbors o
of o
an o
" o
otherworldly o
" o
kind o
. o

The o
new o
roads o
have o
certainly o
brought o
in o
a o
group o
of o
immigrants o
anxious o
to o
escape o
from o
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
and o
return o
to o
nature o
. o

But o
at o
the o
same o
time o
, o
verdant o
Mt. B-LOC
Kuanyin I-LOC
- o
named o
for o
its o
uncanny o
resemblance o
to o
the o
deity o
Kuanyin o
- o
is o
covered o
with o
columbariums o
and o
cemeteries o
. o

Even o
Kuanyin o
, o
worshipped o
for o
her o
limitless o
compassion o
and o
mercy o
, o
must o
be o
creasing o
her o
brow o
at o
this o
rampant o
overuse o
of o
the o
mountain o

kuo I-PER
, o
a o
secretary o
in o
the o
Pali B-GPE
Rural I-GPE
Township I-GPE
government o
, o
says o
facetiously o
: o
" o
What o
can o
we o
do o
? o
We o
have o
the o
mountains o
behind o
us o
and o
the o
sea o
in o
front o
. o

People o
say o
the o
fengshui o
is o
good o
here o
, o
so o
they o
come o
. o
" o

He o
adds o
, o
in o
a o
far o
less o
amused o
tone o
, o
that o
the o
government o
has o
been o
talking o
about o
making o
Mt. B-LOC
Kuanyin I-LOC
a o
national o
park o
for o
a o
long o
time o
, o
and o
has o
banned o
construction o
or o
use o
of o
the o
mountain o
. o

But o
after o
30 o
years o
, o
the o
park o
plan o
is o
still o
a o
non-starter o
, o
and o
meanwhile o
many o
cemeteries o
and o
colum o
- o
bariums o
have o
" o
snuck o
in o

" o

" o
Nobody o
seems o
to o
care o
about o
our o
Pali B-GPE
, o
and o
we o
are o
very o
remote o
, o
so o
people o
just o
dump o
what o
they o
do o
n't o
want o
out o
here o
. o

We o
say o
that o
this o
is o
why o
we o
not o

Located o

of o

the o
people o
of o

take o
it o
in o

that o

Taipei B-GPE

" o
I o
believe o
, o
" o
says o
Lin B-PER
Yi I-PER
- I-PER
hung I-PER
, o
" o
that o
the o
people o
of o
Pali B-GPE
understand o
that o
this o
is o
just o
the o
way o
society o
works o
- o

the o
interests o
of o
the o
few o
are o
sacrificed o
so o
that o
the o
majority o
can o
be o
better o
off o

Thus o
, o
in o

plans o
Pali B-GPE
is o
always o
assigned o
the o
role o
of o
serving o
Taipei B-GPE

" o
But o
the o
government o
should o
think o
carefully o
about o
whether o
they o
are o
using o
the o
right o
methods o
or o
not o

There o
are o
no o

what o
do o
the o

of o

get o
out o

It o
's o

As o

an o
already o
- o

relentlessly o

threatens o
to o

spoil o
the o
dream o
of o

Last o
October o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
unemployment o
rate o
surpassed o
3 o
% o
, o
and o
now o
more o
than o
300,000 o

As o
the o

fades o

for o

so o
that o
the o

becomes o
a o

It o
is o

that o
these o

an o

will o
change o

an o
average o
of o
seven o
times o
in o
a o

30 o

revolve o
in o
a o

whose o

points o
are o
employment o

long o
as o
people o
want o
to o
find o
work o
or o
change o
their o

, o
the o
human o

a o

And o
the o
rise o
of o

has o
brought o
a o

so o
little o
for o

An o
indicator o
of o
how o
good o
this o
market o
looks o
comes o
from o
the o
actions o
of o
the o
United B-ORG

The o
UDN B-ORG
is o
one o
of o
the o

a o

Biung B-ORG

which o
is o
designed o
in o
the o
pattern o
of o

and o
hit o

in o

Why o
does o
this o
venerable o

look o
so o
favorably o
on o

, o
vice-president o

Biung I-ORG
, o
the o
company o
that o
publishes o
Biung o
, o
who o
has o
many o
years o
of o
experience o
in o
publishing o
, o
says o
that o
there o
is o
a o
limit o
to o
how o
many o
people o
are o
reached o
by o
classified o
advertising o
. o

Based o
on o
a o
survey o
conducted o
by o
AC B-PER
Nielsen I-PER
, o
only o
about o
3 o
% o
of o
individuals o
buy o
newspapers o
to o
read o
the o
classified o
ads o
. o

Moreover o
, o
from o
a o
firm o
's o
point o
of o
view o
, o
Lee B-PER
confesses o
, o
classified o
ads o
are o
" o
in o
fact o
rather o
expensive o
. o
" o

It o
costs o
over o
NT$ o
10,000 o
for o
an o
ad o
of o
about o
five o
centimeters o
square o
. o

From o
the o
newspaper o
's o
point o
of o
view o
, o
classified o
ads o
are o
n't o
such o
a o
hot o
property o
either o
, o
since o
most o
of o
the o
profit o
goes o
to o
the o
middlemen o
who o
take o
the o
ads o
. o

These o
limitations o
to o
the o
traditional o
job o
hunting o
formula o
are o
unlikely o
to o
be o
resolved o
in o
the o
short o
term o
, o
says o
Lee B-PER

Lee B-PER
explains o
: o
" o
Looking o
at o
the o
Japanese o
experience o
, o
the B-ORG
Asahi I-ORG
Shimbun I-ORG
has o
a o
daily o
circulation o
of o
about o
10 o
million o
, o
but o
only o
one o
page o
of o
classified o
advertising o
. o

Those o
looking o
for o
new o
jobs o
rely o
more o
on o
employment o
magazines o
. o
" o

The o
attraction o
for o
similar o
magazines o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
being o
helped o
along o
by o
the o
current o
fad o
for o
things o
Japanese o
, o
and o
also o
by o
changes o
in o
how o
publications o
are o
being o
sold o
, o
with o
convenience o
stores o
getting o
publications o
on o
to o
the o
shelves o
much o
faster o
than o
traditional o
bookstores o
ever o
could o
. o

" o
With o
changes o
in o
the o
larger o
environment o
and o
the o
maturing o
of o
the o
market o
, o
this o
is o
the o
time o
to o
jump o
in o
. o
" o

" o
The o
economy o
is o
in o
a o
downturn o
, o
but o
the o
human o
resources o
market o
always o
goes o
against o
the o
current o
, o
" o
says o
Lee B-PER
. o

In o
Japan B-GPE
, o
where o
the o
" o
bubble o
economy o
" o
phenomenon o
has o
been o
the o
worst o
, o
there o
are o
hundreds o
of o
human o
resources o
firms o
competing o
. o

The o
leading o
company o
had o
an o
after o
- o
tax o

last o

of o
US$ o
90 o
million o
. o

Though o
there o
have o
been o
suggestions o
that o
the o
Internet o
is o
already o
becoming o
the o
main o
way o
to o
find o
employment o
, o
Lee B-PER
contends o
that o
" o
the o
obstacles o
to o
entry o
are o
still o
great o
" o
for o
the o
ordinary o
person o
: o
You o
have o
to o
have o
a o
computer o
and o
be o
online o
, o
and o
you o
have o
to o
know o
how o
to o
find o
what o
you o
are o
looking o
for o
. o

When o
you o
consider o
this o
, o
print o
media o
is o
still o
much o
more o
convenient o
. o

, o
began o
invading o
the o
human o

market o
two o
years o
ago o
, o
and o
existing o

went o
on o
a o
binge o
of o

. o

For o
example o
, o
Career B-ORG
Magazine I-ORG
, o

has o
more o
than o
a o

site o
is o
now o
called o

to o
provide o
even o
more o

. o

The o
big o
may o
have o
gotten o

, o
but o
that o
has o
n't o
stopped o

into o

" o
The o
interesting o
thing o
about o

is o
that o
no o

yet o
taken o

for o

There o
is o
much o

for o

and o
no o
one o
can o

how o

Established o

with o
the o
advantage o
that o
many o

out o

But o
their o
weakness o
is o
that o
they o
have o

with o
no o

" o
If o
latecomers o
want o
to o
transcend o
the o

they o
have o
to o
try o
a o
different o

One o
reason o
that o
people o
are o
so o
optimistic o
about o

is o
the o
performance o
of o

they o

Steven B-PER
Su I-PER
says o
that o
" o
we o
will o
always o
have o
competition o
from o
the o
traditional o
media o
like o
China B-ORG
Times I-ORG
and o
United B-ORG
Daily I-ORG
News I-ORG
, o
" o
because o
after o
all o
, o
104 B-ORG
only o
works o
through o
the o
Internet o
. o

He o
does o
not o
, o
however o
, o
fear o
the o
threat o
from o
the o

website o
, o
which o
is o
under o

flag o
, o
nor o
is o
there o
anything o

about o
the o
exploitation o
of o
both o
the o

by o
the o

Last o

Acer B-ORG

invested o
in o
a o
combination o

, o
but o
they o
exhausted o
their o

three o

Moreover o
, o
Su B-PER
is o
skeptical o
about o
the o

of o

at o

" o

But o
the o
people o
at o

are o
very o
optimistic o
. o

As o
Johnson B-PER
Lee I-PER
says o
: o
" o
Some o
people o
try o
to o
open o
the o

with o
a o

are o

" o

The o
UDN B-ORG
group o
is o
undertaking o
a o
three o
- o
pronged o
attack o
to o
crush o
their o
competition o
: o
continuing o
to o
access o
the o
wide o
readership o
of o
newspapers o
, o
targeting o
the o
high o
- o
tech o
sector o
through o
the o
Internet o
, o
and o
using o
the o
magazine o
format o
for o
regional o
companies o
with o
small o
budgets o
. o

Based o
on o
past o
experience o
, o
most o
companies o
have o
used o
up o
their o
employment o
advertising o
budgets o
by o
year o
's o
end o
, o
so o
the o
market o
is o
at o
a o
low o
ebb o
. o

However o
, o
when o
the o
Chinese o
New o
Year o
passes o
, o
many o
employees o
, o
having o
collected o
their o
annual o
bonuses o
, o
want o
to o
change o

, o
and o
this o
is o
when o
the o
market o
really o
heats o
up o
. o

Although o
the o
manpower o

focuses o
on o
bringing o
together o
employers o
with o
job o
- o
seekers o
, o
there o
is o
much o
more o
to o
it o
these o

than o

psychological o

, o
career o

suitability o

, o
job o

, o
and o

in o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
recording o
industry o
. o

In o
the o
1960s o
, o
Hsu B-PER
Tsang I-PER
- I-PER
houei I-PER
, o
Shih B-PER
Wei I-PER
- I-PER
liang I-PER
and o
other o
musicians o
labored o
hard o
at o
making o
collections o
of o
Taiwanese o
folk o
songs o
, o
but o
they o
were o
n't o
able o
to o
release o
them o
. o

It o
was o
n't o
until o
1979 o
, o
when o
Hsu B-PER
delivered o
an o
impassioned o
speech o
at o
the B-ORG
Sanchung I-ORG
Rotary I-ORG
Club I-ORG
about o
this o
problem o
, o
that o
it o
struck o
a o
chord o
with o
someone o
who o
could o
do o
something o
about o
it o
. o

At o
that o
time o
Yeh B-PER
Chin I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
was o
CEO o
of o
First B-ORG
Records I-ORG
, o
which o
subsequently o
released o
a o
series o
of o
21 o
albums o
, o
including o
recordings o
of o
Hakka o
eight o
tone o
, o
Fujian o
ten o
tone o
, o
Hengchun o
- o
style o
sing o
- o
and o
- o
tell o
, o
and o
so o
forth o
. o

It o
was o
the o
best o
collection o
of o
Taiwanese o
folk o
music o
ever o
made o
. o

Although o
the o
series o
, o
as o
expected o
, o
did o
n't o
make o
any o
money o
, o
for o
three o
years o
running o
it o
won o
the o
Golden o
Tripod o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
highest o
music o
award o
. o

" o
It o
's o
not o
that o
I o
'm o
especially o
fond o
of o
music o
or o
culture o
, o
" o
says o
Yeh B-PER
, o
who o
studied o
engineering o
in o
the o
last o
Japanese o
- o
era o
class o
of o
what o
became o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Taipei I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
. o

" o
But o
my o
work o
in o
the o
recording o
industry o
brought o
me o
into o
contact o
with o
Peking B-GPE
opera o
, o
beiguan o
and o
nanguan o
music o
, o
and o
so o
forth o
. o

I o
felt o
that o
those o
recordings o
were o
very o
educational o
and o
ought o
to o
be o
preserved o
. o
" o

Yeh B-PER
still o
regrets o
that o
he o
did o
n't o
have o
video o
equipment o
, o
so o
he o
could o
n't o
also o
make o
video o
records o
of o
folk o
music o
performances o
. o

Back o
in o
the o
early o
1950s o
the o
24 o
- o
year o
- o
old o
Yeh B-PER
worked o
with o
the B-ORG
Broadcasting I-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
to o
record o
albums o
of o
BCC B-ORG
singers o
on o
equipment o
the o
Japanese o
army o
had o
left o
behind o
. o

He o
became o
a o
major o
player o
in o
the o
Taipei B-GPE
music o
industry o
. o

" o
We o
recorded o
Tzu B-PER
Wei I-PER
's I-PER
first o

Green o

, o
" o
says o
Yeh B-PER
, o
half o
closing o
his o
eyes o
as o
he o
recalls o
those o
days o
. o

" o
Who o
would o
have o
thought o
it o
would o
still o
be o
popular o
today o
? o
" o

Later o
Yeh B-PER
established o
the o
Platinum B-ORG
Music I-ORG
recording o
studio o
and o
went o
abroad o
to o
keep o
up o
on o
the o
latest o
industry o
trends o
. o

The o
first o
to o
bring o
multi-track o
stereo o
recording o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
he o
made o
a o
big o
contribution o
toward o
raising o
standards o
in o
the o
recording o
industry o
here o
. o

Platinum B-ORG
is o
still o
going o
, o
run o
by o
senior o
recording o
engineer o
Yeh B-PER
Chui I-PER

Ching I-PER
, o
who o
is o
Yeh B-PER
Chin I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
's I-PER
oldest o
son o
. o

It o
is o
still o
one o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
leading o
studios o
, o
having o
recorded o
such o
chart o
toppers o
as o
Luo B-PER

Cigarette o
cases o
and o
plastic o
milk o
bottles o

Although o
Yeh B-PER
Chin I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
has o
worked o
in o
the o
recording o
industry o
, o
his o
field o
is o
really o
plastics o
and o
machinery o
. o

After o
graduating o
from o
college o
, o
Yeh B-PER
opened o
the B-ORG
Mingli I-ORG
Plastics I-ORG
Factory I-ORG
. o

Their o
first o
product o
was o
a o
plastic o
cigarette o
case o
. o

Back o
in o
those o
days o
farmers o
would o
always o
put o
cigarettes o
in o
their o
pockets o
when o
they o
went o
to o
the o
fields o
, o
but o
they o
would o
often o
find o
that o
their o
cigarettes o
would o
get o
crushed o
before o
they o
had o
a o
chance o
to o
smoke o
them o
. o

Both o
the o
cases o
and o
the o
machines o
to o
make o
them o
sold o
well o
all o
over o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Noting o
that o
glass o
baby o
bottles o
often o
cracked o
when o
boiled o
for o
sterilization o
, o
Yeh B-PER
then o
came o
up o
with o
the o
idea o
of o
replacing o
glass o
with o
polyethylene o
. o

His o
factory o
was o
the o
first o
in o
the o
world o
to o
produce o
plastic o
baby o
bottles o
. o

Yeh B-PER
also o
made o
the o
sterilizers o
, o
and o
both o
lines o
proved o
to o
be o
very o
profitable o
. o

In o
was o
in o
this o
period o
that o
he o
met o
the o
owner o
of o
the o
factory o
across o
from o
his o
, o
who o
was o
a o
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
member o
. o

Through o
him o
, o
Yeh B-PER
reestablished o
connections o
with o
BCC B-ORG
and o
once o
again o
threw o
himself o
into o
the o
recording o
industry o
. o

Yeh B-PER
recalls o
a o
" o
beautiful o
accident o
" o
: o
He o
bought o
a o
second o
- o
hand o
electroplater o
from o
a o
Japanese o
and o
tried o
to o
plate o
various o
plastic o
products o
with o
chrome o
so o
as o
to o
make o
them o
more o
resilient o
. o

Only o
after o
repeated o
failures o
and o
much o
frustration o
did o
he o
think o
about o
electroplating o
his o
black o
plastic o
albums o
with o
nickel o
and o
copper o
to o
make o
them o
stronger o
. o

This o
thrust o
him o
into o
the o
realm o
of o
media o
storage o
. o

" o
The o
times o
change o
faster o
with o
each o
wave o
, o
" o
says o
Yeh B-PER
. o

He o
explains o
that o
it o
took o
100 o
years o
after o
Edison B-PER
invented o
phonograph o
records o
for o
something o
better o
- o
laser o
disks o
- o
to o
appear o
. o

Their o
replacements o
, o
CDs o
and o
VCDs o
, o
are o
now o
cresting o
, o
soon o
to o
be o
vanquished o
by o
DVDs o
, o
which o
though o
next o
in o
line o
are o
already o
feeling o
mini-disks o
closing o
in o
on o
them o
. o

Global o
CD o
- o
ROM o
wars o

Competing o
in o
the o
information o
age o
, o
Yeh B-PER
has o
seen o
industries o
rise o
and o
fall o
. o

Resilient o
and o
flexible o
, o
he o
never o
recoils o
from o
challenges o
. o

Back o
when o
CDs o
were o
still o
in o
their o
infancy o
, o
Yeh B-PER
relied o
on o
his o
old o
relationship o
with o
Sony B-ORG
and o
found o
a o
team o
of o
engineers o
associated o
with o
the B-ORG
Industrial I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
before o
he o
made o
a o
push o
into o
CD o
production o
. o

Starting o
from o
simple o
pieces o
of o
compressed o
plastic o
, o
they o
went o
one o
step o
at o
a o
time o
, o
building o
a o
sturdy o
foundation o
of o
technical o
knowledge o
that o
Ritek B-ORG
still o
enjoys o
today o
. o

In o
1990 o
Ritek B-ORG
started o
to o
press o
CDs o
, o
becoming o
the o
first o
mass o
- o
production o
manufacturer o
of o
CDs o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Back o
then o
, o
it o
cost o
Japanese o
manufacturers o
about o
NT$ o
80 o
to o
press o
one o
CD o
. o

Ritek B-ORG
garnered o
market o
share o
by o
undercutting o
the o
competition o
and o
charging o
only o
NT$ o
50 o
. o

With o
the o
support o
that o
Yeh B-PER
had o
long o
enjoyed o
in o
the o
recording o
industry o
here o
, o
Ritek B-ORG
was o
easily o
able o
to o
market o
its o
goods o
. o

What o
really o
brought o
Ritek B-ORG
into o
the o
realm o
of o
high o
- o
technology o
was o
developing o
its o
own o
CD o
- o
Rs o
-LRB- o
recordable o
CDs o
-RRB- o
. o

Taking o
a o
different o
tack o
from o
the o
Japanese o
, o
who o
were o
plating o
CD o
- o
Rs o
with o
a o
thin o
gold o
layer o
, o
Ritek B-ORG
instead o
developed o
a o
cheap o
and o
high o
- o
quality o
process o
for o
coating o
them o
with o
silver o
or o
aluminum o
. o

These o
allowed o
for o
a o
much o
lower o
price o
that o
in o
turn o
created o
more o
demand o
. o

It o
is o
yet o
another o
example o
of o
a o
Taiwanese o
company o
starting o
a o
global o
price o
war o
. o

Marching o
forward o

Being o
competitive o
in o
terms o
of o
price o
is o
one o
of o
Ritek B-ORG
's o
strong o
points o
, o
but o
it o
's o
not o
the o
whole o
story o
behind o
the o
company o
's o
success o
. o

Another o
important o
factor o
is o
that o
at o
key o
moments o
Yeh B-PER
has o
not o
hesitated o
to o
invest o
the o
necessary o
sums o
when o
it o
was o
necessary o
to o
bring o
the o
technology o
to o
the o
next o
level o
. o

" o
Ten o
years o
ago o
, o
when o
we o
first o
started o
producing o
CDs o
, o
one o
machine o
required o
five o
or o
six o
persons o
to o
operate o
, o
" o
Yeh B-PER
recalls o
. o

" o
When o
a o
flood o
of o
orders o
came o
in o
, o
we o
'd o
have o
everyone o
working o
overtime o
with o
shifts o
going o
around o
the o
clock o
, o
but o
we o
still o
were o
n't o
able o
to o
keep o
up o
with o
demand o
. o

That o
's o
when o
the o
workers o
took o
the o
initiative o
to o
suggest o
that o
we o
automate o
. o
" o

Now o
everything o
from o
ordering o
and o
production o
to o
storage o
and o
shipping o
is o
computerized o
. o

One o
person o
is o
typically o
responsible o
for o
about o
10 o
machines o
. o

The o
whole o
process o
has o
been o
shortened o
, o
and o
quality o
is o
high o
. o

The o
amount o
that o
the o
same o
3,000 o
workers o
can o
produce o
has o
exploded o
from o
200,000 o
a o
month o
to o
200 o
million o
a o
month o
. o

Automation o
has o
meant o
that o
the o
workers o
have o
had o
to o
learn o
how o
to o
operate o
sophisticated o
machinery o
and o
computers o
, o
so o
that o
Ritek B-ORG
has o
advanced o
out o
of o
the o
ranks o
of o
the o
traditional o
plastic o
disc o
pressers o
. o

Automation o
has o
also o
allowed o
the o
company o
to o
lower o
costs o
at o
a o
time o
when o
the o
price o
of o
data o
storage o
media o
has o
been o
plummeting o
. o

In o
the o
third o
quarter o
last o
year o
, o
the o
price o
of o
a o
CD o
- o
ROM o
suddenly o
fell o
from o
60 o
US o
cents o
to o
40 o
cents o
, o
which o
is o
n't o
far o
from o
the o
30 o
cents o
it o
costs o
to o
make o
. o

It o
's o
a o
long o
way o
from o
the o
US$ o
14 o
that o
they o
cost o
when o
they o
first o
hit o
the o
market o
five o
years o
ago o
. o

Yet o
Ritek B-ORG
has o
still o
managed o
to o
maintain o
operating o
profits o
of o
22 o
% o
, o
and o
the o
falling o
prices o
have o
n't o
crushed o
it o
. o

The o
coming o
wave o
of o
technology o
will o
focus o
on o
light o
and o
small o
portable o
data o
devices o
such o
as o
PDAs o
and o
MP3 o
players o
, o
so o
the o
challenge o
for o
Ritek B-ORG
is o
allowing o
devices o
that o
are o
becoming o
smaller o
and o
smaller o
to o
have o
larger o
data o
capacities o
and o
higher o
fidelity o
. o

Yeh B-PER
points o
out o
that o
the o
patent o
rights o
for o
mini-discs o
are o
owned o
entirely o
by o
big o
Japanese o
companies o
, o
but o
Ritek B-ORG
is o
the o
only o
company o
manufacturing o
them o
. o

Ritek B-ORG
is o
also o
part o
of o
a o
group o
-LRB- o
which o
includes o
Dataplay B-ORG
, o
Samsung B-ORG
and o
Toshiba B-ORG
-RRB- o
that o
is o
researching o
and o
developing o
a o
data o
storage o
device o
no o
larger o
than o
a o
wrist o
watch o
, o
as o
well o
as o
the o
applications o
for o
it o
. o

Ritek B-ORG
will o
be o
responsible o
for o
the o
production o
of o
the o
disk o
. o

A o
year o
and o
a o
half o
ago o
Ritek B-ORG
invested o
in o
the o
production o
of o
OLED o
-LRB- o
organic o
light o
- o
emitting o
diode o
-RRB- o
displays o
, o
which o
is o
yet o
another o
technology o
used o
in o
portable o
computing o
devices o
that o
relies o
on o
thin o
opto o
- o
electrical o
film o
application o
techniques o
. o

Currently o
Ritek B-ORG
is o
the o
largest o
producer o
of o
OLEDs o
in o
the o
world o
. o

Ritek B-ORG
has o
also o
begun o
to o
explore o
fiber o
optics o
used o
in o
the o
information o
industry o
. o

Last o
year o
Ritek B-ORG
invested o
in o
production o
of o
fiber o
- o
optic o
connectors o
with o
Taiwan B-ORG
Memory I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
. o

This o
one o
of o
the o
products o
Yeh B-PER
is o
proudest o
of o
. o

" o
In o
the o
future o
, o
when o
fiber o
optic o
applications o
mature o
, o
a o
house o
will o
need o
a o
dozen o
or o
so o
of o
these o
connectors o
, o
" o
Yeh B-PER
says o
. o

Currently o
, o
the o
fiber o
optic o
connectors o
being o
produced o
by o
TMT B-ORG
sell o
for o
US$ o
7 o
a o
piece o
. o

But o
they o
ca o
n't o
keep o
up o
with o
demand o
, o
so o
Yeh B-PER
has o
gone o
to o
the o
mainland o
to o
establish o
more o
factories o
, o
where o
he o
has o
cast o
his o
eyes o
upon o
the o
vast o
mainland o
market o
. o

On o
the o
topic o
of o
fiber o
optics o
and o
the o
internet o
, o
Yeh B-PER
is o
particularly o
knowledgeable o
and o
incisive o
. o

Whenever o
Yeh B-PER
goes o
to o
Japan B-GPE
he o
happily o
brings o
back o
lots o
of o
Japanese o
books o
about o
economics o
and o
technology o
, o
such o
as o
those o
about o
third o
- o
generation o
mobile o
phones o
, o
hand o
- o
held o
devices o
and o
so o
forth o
. o

" o
I o
study o
the o
concepts o
presented o
in o
these o
books o
, o
and o
then o
I o
use o
the o
viewpoint o
of o
a o
businessman o
to o
see o
if o
there o
would o
be o
any o
problems o
implementing o
them o
. o
" o

Yeh o
has o
a o
house o
full o
of o
Japanese o
books o
and o
reads o
Japanese o
newspapers o
every o
day o
. o

Working o
hard o
to o
get o
a o
grip o
on o
technological o
trends o
, o
he o
believes o
that o
only o
the o
far o
- o
sighted o
will o
end o
up o
winners o
. o

He o
often o
cites o
the o
example o
of o
the o
owner o
of o
the o
Japanese o
fast o
food o
chain o
Yoshinoya B-ORG
, o
who o
predicted o
as o
early o
as o
1980 o
, o
when o
there o
was o
a o
great o
US B-GPE
- o
Japan B-GPE
trade o
imbalance o
, o
that o
America B-GPE
would o
force o
Japan B-GPE
to o
open o
its o
beef o
market o
. o

Taking o
hold o
of o
the o
opportunity o
, o
he o
bought o
a o
cattle o
ranch o
in o
America B-GPE
. o

He o
had o
n't o
expected o
that o
strident o
protests o
from o
Japanese o
farmers o
would o
delay o
the o
market o
opening o
. o

As o
a o
result o
, o
Yoshinoya B-ORG
struggled o
for o
many o
years o
and o
nearly o
went o
bankrupt o
. o

For o
the o
past o
two o
years o
, o
however o
, o
Japan B-GPE
has o
been o
open o
to o
imported o
beef o
, o
and o
Yoshinoya B-ORG
has o
done o
very o
well o
. o

And o
its o
chairman o
Matsuda B-PER
has o

The o

in o

combines o
working o
out o
with o
recreation o
and o
the o
traditional o
Chinese o
idea o
of o
" o
health o

" o

Of o
particular o

has o

aromatherapy o
, o
with o
its o

age o
underpinning o
of o
the o
integration o
of o
" o
body o

, o
and o
spirit o
. o
" o

What o
exactly o
is o
aromatherapy o
? o

What o
can o
it o
do o
for o
you o
? o

Aromatherapy o
involves o
the o
use o
of o
" o
essential o
oils o
" o
extracted o
from o
the o
flowers o
, o
leaves o
, o
branches o
, o
bark o
, o

or o

of o

" o

" o
-LRB- o
usually o
a o
vegetable o
oil o
-RRB- o

, o
" o
In o
fact o
you o
could o
consider o
aromatherapy o
the o
latest o
trend o
in o
personal o
care o
. o

To o
combine o
this o
with o
working o
out o
is o
to o
combine o
a o
beauty o
perspective o
with o
a o
health o
one o
, o
with o
more o
of o
a o

feel o

" o

There o
's o
nothing o
new o
about o
aroma o

People o
in o
ancient o
Rome B-GPE
often o
rubbed o
their o
bodies o
with o
oil o
in o
the o
public o
baths o
as o
a o
means o
of o
relieving o

which o
are o
functionally o
the o

as o
aromatherapy o

So o
why o
the o
sudden o
surge o
of o
interest o
? o

Perhaps o
there o
is o
a o
greater o
need o
among o
modern o
people o
- o
plagued o
by o
stress o
, o
insomnia o
, o
anxiety o

and o

As o

" o
In o
the o

Sandalwood o

Rose o
is o

Ho B-PER

hsien I-PER
, o
a o
doctor o
of o
traditional o
Chinese o
medicine o
, o
says o
that o
Chinese o
medicine o
has o
long o
included o
some o
aromatherapy o
- o
like o
treatments o
, o
and o
theoretically o
it o
is o
possible o
for o
the o
medicinal o
effects o
of o
oils o
to o
be o
transmitted o
to o
the o
body o
through o
the o
meridians o
using o
tuina o
-LRB- o
traditional o
Chinese o
massage o
therapy o
-RRB- o
. o

" o
Things o
used o
in o
aroma o
- o
therapy o
like o
lavender o
and o
sandalwood o
definitely o
help o
people o
relax o
and o
sleep o
better o
, o
and o
can o
relieve o
tension o
and o
headaches o
, o
" o
says o
Dr. o
Ho B-PER
. o

" o
But o
, o
" o
he o
cautions o
, o
" o
the o
user o
has o
to o
put o
him o
- o
or o
herself o
in o
the o
proper o
frame o
of o
mind o
to o
relax o
, o
or o
else o
the o
effect o
will o
be o
largely o
cancelled o
out o
. o
" o

He o
adds o
, o
moreover o
, o
that o
he o
remains o
skeptical o
of o
claims o
of o
wider o
curative o
powers o
for o
aromatherapy o
. o

A o
Miss o

, o
who o
sometimes o
goes o
to o

mellow o
out o

" o
But o
at o
one o
or o
two o
thousand o
NT o

per o
time o
, o
it o
's o
too o
expensive o
to o
go o
to o
the o
health o

more o
than o
once o
in o
a o

I o
more o
often o

use o
them o
at o

just o
take o
a o

a o
" o
Celebrating o
Oriental o
New o
Year o
" o
event o
at o
this o
time o
every o
year o
as o
a o
way o
of o
encouraging o
cultural o
interchange o
, o
but o
every o
year o
it o
is o
a o
struggle o
to o
find o
co-sponsors o
willing o
to o
provide o
funding o
. o

On o
this o
occasion o
, o
R.C. B-PER

committed o
support o
there o
were o
more o
than o
30 o
snack o
booths o
present o
, o
giving o
the o
event o
the o
lively o
feel o
of o
a o
Chinese o
temple o
celebration o
. o

The o
foreigners o
[ o
non-ethnic o
Chinese o
] o
present o
were o
amazed o
in o
particular o
by o
the o
mass o
dragon o
dance o
that o
members o
of o
the o
Association B-ORG
performed o
. o

A o
few o
years o
ago o
, o
when o
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
was o
newly o
opened o
up o
to o
immigration o
and o
there o
were o
n't o
many o
Chinese o
around o
, o
hardly o
anyone o
had o
heard o
of o
the B-ORG
Hua I-ORG
- I-ORG
Hsia I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, o
and o
inviting o
government o
officials o
to o
attend o
such o
events o
was o
always o
fraught o
with o
difficulty o
. o

As o
more o
and o
more o
Asian o
immigrants o
arrived o
, o
members o
of o
Parliament B-ORG
- o
vying o
for o
votes o
- o
began o
participating o
enthusiastically o
in o
the o
Association B-ORG
's o
events o
. o

The o
fact o
that o
the o
Association B-ORG
has o
supported o
charitable o
causes o
in o
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
for o
many o
years o
, o
donating o
time o
and o
money o
, o
has o
been o
especially o
important o
in o
terms o
of o
getting o
taken o
seriously o
by o
the o
government o
, o
and o
it o
is o
thanks o
to o
the o
efforts o
of o
immigrants o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
that o
successes o
like o
the o
New o
Year o
celebration o
have o
become o
possible o
. o

For o
our o
family o
, o
it o
was o
our o
tenth o
year o
in o
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
since o
arriving o
as o
immigrants o
. o

Our o
daughter o
had o
just o
turned o
ten o
and o
our o
son o
was o
starting o
primary o
school o
when o
we o
came o
here o
. o

During o
the o
tough o
years o
as o
new o
immigrants o
we o
overcame o
numerous o
difficulties o
of o
language o
and o
culture o
, o
working o
to o
establish o
ourselves o
in o
this o
foreign o
land o
. o

We o
wanted o
our o
children o
to o
quickly o
adapt o
to o
the o
Western o
world o
but o
without o
forgetting o
their o
Chinese o
roots o
, o
so o
we o
endlessly o
reminded o
them o
that o
we o
will o
always o
be o
" o
descendants o
of o
the B-PER
Yellow I-PER
Emperor I-PER
, o
" o
and o
urged o
them o
to o
merge o
into o
Western o
society o
with o
the o
characteristic o
tenacity o
and o
humanity o
of o
Chinese o
people o
. o

When o
the o
UAA B-ORG
was o
first o
set o
up o
in o
1995 o
, o
Sharon B-PER
came o
to o
our o
house o
in o
need o
of o
assistance o
from o
the o
Chinese o
community o
, o
filled o
with o
enthusiasm o
but o
uncertain o
about o
how o
to o
make o
contact o
with o
the o
Chinese o
. o

Our o
daughter o
has o
been o
Sharon B-PER
's o
pal o
ever o
since o
, o
and o
it o
was o
she o
who o
suggested o
that o
Sharon B-PER
see o
R.C. B-PER
Shih I-PER
about o
a o
co-sponsor o
for o
this o
year o
's o
New o
Year o
celebration o
. o

Several o
weeks o
before o
the o
event o
Sharon B-PER
asked o
me o
if o
I o
wanted o
to o
design o
a o
special o
garland o
to o
welcome o
the o
prime o
minister o
. o

As o
a o
Howick B-GPE
resident o
and o
a o
floral o
designer o
, o
how o
could o
I o
refuse o
? o

I o
used o
scarlet o
silk o
cord o
and o
miniature o
embroidered o
Chinese o
slippers o
-LRB- o
as o
used o
in o
Chinese o
knotting o
-RRB- o
along o
with o
dried o
flowers o
, o
to o
make o
a o
red o
and o
gold o
garland o
. o

As o
I o
put o
it o
on o
the o
premier o
I o
explained o
that o
these o
were o
lucky o
colors o
used o
for o
Chinese o
New o
Year o
. o

She o
was o
delighted o
with o
this o
beautiful o
souvenir o
, o
rich o
in o
Chinese o
culture o
and o
art o
, o
and o
said o
she o
would o
keep o
it o
forever o
. o

With o
the o
steady o
introduction o
of o
Chinese o
culture o
into o
this o
country o
, o
New o
Zealanders o
are o
generally o
more o
aware o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
than o
before o
, o
and o
immigrants o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
been o
working o
hard o
to o
soften o
the o
anti-Asian o
sentiments o
of o
the o
locals o
. o

When o
the o
program o
of o
New o
Year o
performances o
wrapped o
up o
, o
many o
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
friends o
came o
forward o
to o
express o
their o
thanks o
, o
saying o
that o
they o
now o
felt o
more o
familiar o
with o
China B-GPE
and o
were o
eagerly o
looking o
forward o
to o
next o
year o

diplomatic o

, o
was o
hit o
on o
January o
13 o
by o
an o
earthquake o
measuring o
between o
7.4 o
and o
7.9 o
on o
the o
Richter B-PER
scale o
. o

The o
earthquake o
killed o
hundreds o
and o
left o
tens o
of o
thousands o
homeless o
. o

As o
soon o
as o
reports o
of o
the o
earthquake o
came o
in o
, o
the o
ROC B-GPE
government o
donated o
US$ o
200,000 o
to o
support o
disaster o
relief o
efforts o
, o
and o
within o
24 o
hours o
had o
dispatched o
a o
team o
to o
help o
rescue o
victims o
. o

It o
truly o
does o
seem o
that o
" o
when o
it o

, o
it o

, o
" o
for o
India B-GPE
was o
then o
visited o
on o

by o
its o
biggest o
earthquake o
in o
50 o

, o
and o
according o
to o
official o
estimates o
the o
death o
toll o
may o
rise o
to o
over o
20,000 o
. o

Although o
the o
ROC B-GPE
does o
not o
have o
official o
ties o
with o

, o
as o

went o

were o
standing o
by o
for o

only o
the o

ahead o
from o

. o

Just o
short o
of o
noon o
on o
Saturday o
, o
January o
13 o
, o
most o
everyone o
in o
El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
was o
at o
home o
preparing o
for o
lunch o
when o
the o
earth o
below o
their o
feet o
suddenly o
began o
to o
shake o
violently o
. o

Just o
outside o
the o
capital o
of o

Salvador I-GPE
, o
a o
hillside o
collapsed o
in o
the o
community o
of o

, o
burying o
more o
than o
260 o

and o
1,200 o

. o

As o
of o

the o

at o

Over o

The o

This o
team o
, o
which o
had o
received o
three o
months o
of o
training o
in o

where o
the o
worst o
of o
the o

The o

started o
out o
using o
advanced o
equipment o
capable o
of o

under o
the o
rubble o
, o
including o
flexible o
fiber o

cables o
and o
ultra-sensitive o

devices o
. o

When o
these o
methods o
did o
not o
yield o
survivors o
, o
the o
team o
began o
digging o
and o
using o
more o
aggressive o
search o
techniques o
. o

These o
methods o
, o
too o
, o
failed o
to o
turn o
up o
any o
sign o
of o

At o
that o
point o

with o

were o

Now o
that o
a o
similar o
disaster o
has o
been o
visited o
upon o
one o
of o
our o
diplomatic o
partners o
, o
it o
is o
time o
for o
the o
ROC B-GPE
to o
repay o
its o
debt o
to o
the o
international o
community o
. o

The o
power o
of o
nature o

Major o
earthquakes o
in o
recent o
years o
have o
claimed o
nearly o
20,000 o
lives o
in o
Turkey B-GPE
and o
over o
2,500 o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

The o
death o
toll o
in o
El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
is o
expected o
to o
climb o
to o
over o
1,300 o
. o

In o
the o
meantime o
, o
the o
Richter o
7.9 o
earthquake o
in o
India B-GPE
's o
western o
state o
of o
Gujarat B-GPE
has o
completely o
leveled o
the o
town o
of o
Bhuj B-GPE
, o
and o
official o
sources o
expect o
the o
death o
toll o
to o
exceed o
20,000 o
. o

While o
relief o
teams o
have o
been o
dispatched o
from o
around o
the o
world o
, o
India o
indicated o
that o
it o
would o
not o
need o
assistance o
from o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o
the o
time o
being o
. o

There o
is o
nothing o
anyone o
can o
do o
to o
prevent o
earthquakes o
from o
occurring o
, o
but o
specialists o
have o
noted o
that o
the o
consequences o
of o
the o
recent o
quakes o
were o
made o
worse o
by o
man o
- o
made o
factors o
, o
such o
as o
overpopulation o
, o
environmental o
degradation o
, o
and o
shoddy o
construction o
. o

El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
is o
the o
most o
densely o
populated o
nation o
in o
Central B-LOC
America I-LOC
, o
with o
some o
6 o
million o
people o
living o
in o
a o
territory o
covering o
over o
20,000 o
square o
kilometers o
-LRB- o
about o
two o
- o
thirds o
the o
size o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
-RRB- o
. o

The o
economy o
has o
been o
developing o
briskly o
ever o
since o
the o
country o
's o
long o
civil o
war o
came o
to o
an o
end o
in o
1992 o
, o
and o
El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
plays o
an o
important o
political o
role o
both o
internationally o
and o
in o
the o
Central o
American o
region o
. o

In o
these o
respects o
, o
El B-GPE
Salvador I-GPE
's I-GPE
situation o
is o
very o
similar o
to o
that o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

Overdevelopment o
of o
the o
hillside o
at o
Las B-GPE
Colinas I-GPE
may o
have o
been o
one o
cause o
of o
the o
landslide o
that o
buried o
the o
residential o
neighborhood o
down o
below o
. o

After o
one o
has o
seen o
so o
many o
dead o
bodies o
and o
heard o
the o
anguished o
wailing o
of o
bereaved o
relatives o
, o
it o
is o
hard o
to o
ignore o
the o
wisdom o
of o
calls o
to o
live o
in o
harmony o
with o
nature o
. o

It o
takes o
a o
very o
long o
time o
to o
recover o
from o
an o
earthquake o
. o

After o
the o
search o
and o
rescue o
operations o
have o
come o
to o
an o
end o
, o
reconstruction o
begins o
. o

This o
is o
a o
massive o
undertaking o
that o
never o
proceeds o
quickly o
. o

In o
a o
message o
to o
the o
international o
community o
, o
President o
Flores B-PER
stated o
, o
" o
I o
hope o
that o

It o
should o

In o
a o
lively o
and o
well o
- o
attended o
ceremony o
on o
an o
unusually o
warm o
and o
sunny o
winter o
's o
day o
, o
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
in o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
is o
formally o
opened o
to o
the o
public o
. o

Especially o
noteworthy o
is o
Room o
203 o
, o
" o
Echoes o
Across o
Space o
- o
Time o
, o
" o
where o
there o
is o
an o
exhibit o
that o
seems o
quite o
out o
of o
the o
ordinary o
: o
rough o
sandy o
earth o
, o
an o
upright o
measuring o
stick o
. o
. o
. o
it o
is o
more o
like o
the o
site o
of o
an o
archeological o
dig o
. o

The o
layers o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
represent o
different o
cultures o
that o
existed o
at o
various o
times o
in o
the o
past o
. o

It o
is o
almost o
impossible o
to o
tell o
that o
these o
rudimentary o
yet o
beautiful o
works o
of o
pottery o
are o
not o
the o
real o
thing o
. o

They o
are o
in o
fact o
reproductions o
by o
the o
potter o
Cheng B-PER
Yung I-PER
- I-PER
gwo I-PER
. o

It o
is o
especially o
fitting o
that o
they o
should o
be o
Cheng B-PER
's o
work o
, o
because o
this o
unusual o
artist o
was o
formerly o
a o
student o
of o
archeology o
. o

Let o
's o
go o
back o
to o
the o
eve o
of o
the o
opening o
. o

The o
museum o
- o
located o
very o
near o
the o
Yingko B-LOC
interchange o
of o
the o
Second o
Northern o
Freeway o
- o
is o
hopping o
with o
people o
scurrying o
and o
working o
inside o
and o
out o
. o

In o
the o
main o
hall o
on o
the o
first o
floor o
stand o
more o
than o
a o
dozen o
giant o
porcelain o
vases o
, o
representing o
the o
pottery o
industry o
of o
Yingko B-LOC
. o

When o
you o
climb o
to o
the o
second o
floor o
, o
in o
Room o
201 o
a o
worker o
is o
stirring o
cement o
with o
all o
his o
might o
in o
preparation o
for o
putting o
up o
a o
decorative o
wall o
of o
cement o
interspersed o
with o
ceramic o
pieces o
. o

And o
in o
Room o
203 o
, o
a o
group o
of o
people o
are o
busy o
putting o
the o
finished o
reproductions o
on o
display o
, o
documenting o
the o
process o
on o
video o
as o
they o
go o
along o
. o

Suddenly o
there o
is o
a o
crash o
, o
followed o
by o
a o
gasp o
, o
and o
Lu B-PER

, o
director o

the B-ORG

, o
rushes o
in o
to o
see o
what o
has o
happened o
. o

A o
camera o
lens o
has o
fallen o
off o
and o
struck o
a o
Yuanshan o
Culture o
jar o
. o

" o
Teacher o
Cheng B-PER
, o
is o
there o
anything o
wrong o
? o
" o
asks o
Lu B-PER
nervously o
. o

Cheng B-PER
Yung I-PER
- I-PER
gwo I-PER
turns o
the o
piece o
in o
his o
hands o
, o
examining o
it o
carefully o
for o
damage o
. o

Then o
he o
raises o
his o
head o
and o
smiles o
: o
" o
It o
's o
a o
good o
thing o
I o
increased o
the o
kiln o
temperature o
to o
make o
these o
things o
more o
durable o
, o
because o
I o
was o
worried o
about o
the o
knocks o
they o
would o
take o
being o
moved o
around o
for o
the o
exhibition o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
Yung I-PER
- I-PER
gwo I-PER
, o
who o
is o
addressed o
by o
the o
respectful o
title o
" o
Teacher o
Cheng B-PER
" o
by o
all o
the o
museum o
staff o
high o
and o
low o
, o
is o
one o
of o
the o
Young o
Turks o
on o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
ceramics o
scene o
. o

He o
first o
gained o
fame o
with o
an o
award o
- o
winnnig o
entry o
in o
the o
annual o
Golden o
Ceramics o
Award o
competition o
. o

But o
the o
most o
important o
reason o
why o
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
gave o
him o
sole o
and o
total o
control o
over o
the o
recreation o
of o
the o
36 o
pieces o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
in o
the o
exhibit o
is o
this o
: o
He o
is o
the o
only o
leading o
ceramicist o
in o
all o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
who o
also o
graduated o
from o
university o
with o
a o
degree o
in o
archeology o
. o

A o
great o
deal o
of o
effort o
has o
been o
devoted o
to o
opening o
new o
museums o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
recent o
years o
. o

Besides o
institutions o
devoted o
to o
the o
natural o
sciences o
, o
the o
main o
focus o
has o
been o
on o
local o
Taiwanese o
history o
and o
aboriginal o
culture o
. o

Examples o
include o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Prehistory I-ORG
, o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
's I-GPE
Yingko B-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
and o
Shihsanhang B-ORG
Museum I-ORG
, o
and o
the o
privately o
founded o
Sheng B-ORG
Ye I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Formosan I-ORG
Aborigines I-ORG
. o

For o
museums o
, o
the o
most o
important o
thing o
is o
of o
course o
to o
acquire o
items o
to o
display o
. o

But o
most o
archeological o
artifacts o
are o
only o
shards o
, o
and o
the o
few o
items o
that o
have o
been o
found o
intact o
are o
jealously o
guarded o
by o
the o
institutions o
that o
dug o
them o
up o
; o
they o
are o
rarely o
lent o
out o
. o

Thus o
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
's I-ORG
only o
option o
was o
to o
find o
someone o
to o
make o
copies o
of o
the o
originals o
. o

This o
was o
vital o
because o
, o
during o
the o
planning o
stage o
for o
the o
museum o
, o
it o
was o
decided o
to o
establish o
a o
very o
special o
room o
to o
be o
called o
" o
Echoes o
Across o
Space o
- o
Time o
. o
" o

" o
We o
felt o
that o
Taiwan B-GPE
ceramics o
should o
cover o
more o
than o
just o
what o
Han o
Chinese o
people o
have o
done o
in o
the o
400 o
years o
since o
large o
- o
scale o
migration o
began o
from o
the o
mainland o
, o
but o
should o
also o
include o
aboriginal o
and o
prehistoric o
pottery o
. o

But o
it o
is o
quite o
a o
challenge o
to o
effectively o
create o
such o
a o
comprehensive o
display o
, o
especially o
since o
authentic o
pieces o
are o
so o
hard o
to o
come o
by o
. o

that o
most o
of o
the o
genuine o

are o
held o
by o

The o
museum o
sent o
a o
written o
request o
to o
NTU B-ORG
asking o
to o
borrow o
samples o
from o
which o
copies o
could o
be o
made o
, o
but o
that o
idea o
quickly o
hit o
the o
shoals o
. o

NTU B-ORG
's o
archeology o
departmental o
affairs o
committee o
decided o
that o
the o
museum o
should o
have o
first o
submitted o
a o
cooperation o
proposal o
prior o
to o
asking o
for o
any o
loans o
. o

Lu B-PER
Hsiu I-PER
- I-PER
chin I-PER
says o
with o
exasperation o
: o
" o
This o
was o
not o
an o
unreasonable o
request o
. o

But o
by o
that o
point o
we o
had o
no o
time o
to o
lose o
, o
and o
it o
would o
have o
been o
problematic o
to o
file o
a o
retroactive o
proposal o
. o
" o

After o
asking o
around o
, o
the o
museum o
found o
an o
old o
gent o
- o
a o
specialist o
in o
making o
fiberglass o
reproductions o
of o
old o
artifacts o
- o
who o
had o
done o
similar o
work o
for o
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Prehistory I-ORG
. o

But o
when o
Lu B-PER
examined o
the o
finished o
products o
, o
though o
the o
shapes o
were o
super o
, o
the o
reproductions o
did o
n't o
capture o
the o
texture o
of o
the o
original o
visually o
, o
much o
less o
when o
picked o
up o
in o
the o
hand o
. o

At o
this o
point o
, o
Lu B-PER
had o
little o
choice o
but o
to o
turn o
for o
help o
to o
Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
, o
a o
research o
fellow o
at o
the B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
History I-ORG

Philology I-ORG
. o

Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
is o
renowned o
in o
the o
archeological o
community o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
for o
his o
field o
research o
. o

He o
has o
done o
the o
initial o
field o
work o
on o
dozens o
of o
important o
sites o
, o
including o
Shihsanhang o
, o
Tachuwei o
, o
and o
Peiyeh o
. o

His o
ambition o
is o
to o
uncover o
the o
relationship o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
indigenous o
peoples o
and o
its o
prehistoric o
cultures o
. o

He o
is o
also o
the o
one o
who o
was o
asked o
to o
select o
the o
36 o
prehistoric o
pottery o
samples o
to o
be o
displayed o
at o
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
. o

In o
love o
with o
archeology o

Lu B-PER
asked o
Liu B-PER
for o
advice o
about o
people o
qualified o
to o
do o
reproductions o
of o
ancient o
pottery o
. o

She o
hit o
the o
jackpot o
, o
because o
Liu B-PER
happened o
to o
have o
a o
good o
friend o
named o
Cheng B-PER
Yung I-PER
- I-PER
gwo I-PER
, o
a o
ceramic o
artist o
, o
who o
had o
also o
studied o
in o
the B-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Archeology I-ORG
and I-ORG
Anthropology I-ORG
at o
NTU B-ORG
. o

" o
Cheng B-PER
was o
three o
years o
behind o
me o
in o
school o
, o
and o
we o
worked o
together o
on o
digs o
for o
many o
years o
. o

When o
he o
was o
in o
college o
, o
he o
worked o
on o
the o
Peinan o
and o
Chihshanyen o
sites o
, o
" o
says o
Liu B-PER
. o

Peinan o
society o
had o
highly o
developed o
pottery o
arts o
, o
and o
Chihshanyen o
is o
a o
multi-layered o
site o
with o
artifacts o
from o
several o
cultures o
, o
and o
the o
pottery o
is o
even o
more o
refined o
. o

In o
fact o
, o
Cheng B-PER
's o
inspiration o
for o
ceramics o
originally o
came o
from o
archeology o
. o

Liu B-PER
continues o
: o
" o
Though o
later o
Cheng B-PER
left o
archeology o
to o
do o
ceramic o
art o
, o
he o
did o
not o
forget o
his o
affection o
for o
prehistoric o
pottery o
, o
and o
his o
early o
work o
was o
influenced o
by o
ancient o
painted o
pottery o
. o
" o

Liu B-PER
notes o
that o
in o
recent o
years o
there o
has o
been o
growing o
demand o
for o
archeological o
artifacts o
for o
displays o
, o
precisely o
fitting o
with o
Cheng B-PER
's o
familiarity o
with o
ceramic o
art o
and o
his o
understanding o
of o
archeological o
work o
. o

As o
Lu B-PER
Hsiu I-PER
- I-PER
chin I-PER
says o
, o
with o
the o
satisfaction o
that o
comes o
of o
knowing o
one o
has o
got o
just o
what o
one o
wants o
, o
" o
He o
is o
the o
ideal o
person o
to o
do o
reproductions o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
. o
" o

A o
ceramicist o
who o
reads o
academic o
papers o

In o
fact o
, o
this o
is o
the o
fourth o
time o
that o
Cheng B-PER
has o
done o
reproductions o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
. o

He o
previously o
worked o
on o
special o
exhibitions o
of o
Chihshanyen B-LOC
and o
Yuanshan B-LOC
culture o
and o
also o
for o
the B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
Provincial I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
. o

But o
never o
before o
had o
he o
been o
given o
a o
task o
as o
challenging o
as o
making o
reproductions o
representing o
all o
the o
major o
sites o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

In o
the o
process o
of o
making o
his o
recreations o
, o
Cheng B-PER
was o
unable o
to o
get o
around o
the o
rigid o
system o
of o
controls o
to o
secure o
any o
original o
samples o
. o

" o
What o
is o
so o
incredible o
about o
Cheng B-PER
Yung I-PER
- I-PER
gwo I-PER
is o
that o
he o
only o
looked o
at o
the o
samples o
and o
took o
back o
some o
photographs o
to o
work o
with o
, o
" o
says o
Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
. o

Take o
for o
example o
the o
human o
- o
faced o
jar o
from o
the o
Shisanhang o
culture o
. o

The o
visage o
depicted o
on o
the o
piece o
is o
of o
complex o
design o
, o
with o
sharp o
angles o
and o
corners o
. o

For o
the o
work o
to o
be o
faithful o
to o
the o
original o
each o
angle o
had o
to o
be o
precise o
. o

Cheng B-PER
tackled o
this o
problem o
by o
assembling o
a o
number o
of o
paper o
models o
before o
getting o
to o
work o
. o

But o
he o
also o
had o
to o
try o
to o
duplicate o
the o
red o
color o
of o
the o
piece o
, o
a o
color o
characteristic o
of o
Shisanhang o
pottery o
. o

For o
this o
reason o
Cheng B-PER
made o
a o
special o
trip o
to o
the B-LOC
Linkou I-LOC
Plateau I-LOC
to o
collect o
red o
clay o
. o

But o
he o
found o
this o
material o
impossible o
to o
get o
into o
the o
right o
shape o
, o
so o
he o
had o
to o
add o
a o
certain o
proportion o
of o
general o
- o
purpose o
potter o
's o
clay o
. o

After o
several o
tries o
, o
he o
settled o
on o
a o
combination o
of o
three o
parts o
Tachia o
clay o
to o
one o
part o
Linkou o
clay o
, o
with o
a o
35 o
% o
ratio o
of o
gravel o
, o
and o
a o
layer o
of o
100 o
% o
Linkou o
red o
clay o
added o
to o
the o
outside o
. o

Finally o
, o
he o
polished o
the o
surface o
with o
agate o
, o
creating o
a o
glossy o
effect o
and o
increasing o
the o
richness o
of o
the o
color o
. o

Like o
a o
detective o
on o
a o
case o

Even o
Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
could o
n't o
say o
enough o
about o
Cheng B-PER
's o
human o
- o
faced o
jar o
. o

Pointing o
to o
the o
photo o
on o
the o
cover o
of o
the o
brochure o
for o
the o
Shisanhang o
site o
museum o
, o
he o
testifies o
: o
" o
I o
was o
the o
person o
who o
dug o
up o
the o
original o
, o
so o
I o
should o
know o
- o
the o
color o
in o
the o
photograph o
is o
not o
right o
, o
while o
Cheng B-PER
is o
much o
closer o
to o
the o
real o
thing o
. o
" o

For o
Cheng B-PER
, o
the o
hardest o
thing o
was o
the o
facial o
expression o
. o

" o
The o
face o
is o
not o
smiling o
, o
but o
it o
is o
not o
crying o
either o
, o
rather o
it o
looks o
a o
bit o
depressed o
. o
" o

He o
says o
that o
this o
is o
a o
very o
impractical o
piece o
, o
so o
its o
original o
purpose o
was o
probably o
decorative o
or o
ritualistic o
. o

In o
an o
effort o
to o
capture o
the o
ambivalent o
facial o
expression o
, o
he o
imagined o
the o
jar o
as o
a o
bust o
- o
length o
portrait o
of o
a o
woman o
. o

She o
would o
be o
an o
elegantly o
dressed o
noblewoman o
, o
with o
brushed o
hair o
, o
and o
jewelry o
made o
from o
shells o
, o
with o
perhaps o
an o
agate o
necklace o
. o
. o
. o
. o

" o
During o
his o
days o
as o
a o
student o
, o
" o
says o
Liu B-PER
of o
Cheng B-PER
, o
" o
he o
did o
hands o
- o
on o
work o
at o
archeological o
sites o
, o
digging o
up o
shards o
, o
observing o
, o
and o
in o
his o
mind o
recreating o
the o
process o
by o
which o
they o
may o
have o
been o
made o
. o

He o
has o
always o
had o
a o
naturally o
deep o
attachment o
to o
archeology o
. o
" o

Liu B-PER
says o
that o
this o
is o
probably o
the o
reason o
why o
Cheng B-PER
, o
when o
doing o
reproductions o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
, o
aims o
to o
capture o
the o
spirit o
of o
the o
originals o
, o
not o
just o
their o
surface o
appearance o
. o

Even o
more o
important o
for o
reproducing o
prehistoric o
artifacts o
is o
good o
detective o
work o
. o

You o
have o
to o
be o
able o
to o
reconstruct o
the o
general o
design o
of o
the o
original o
from o
clues o
on o
just o
a o
few o
shards o
. o

Conclusions o
that o
rest o
on o
a o
single o
sample o
may o
easily o
be o
inaccurate o
. o

Cheng B-PER
, o
using o
his o
training o
in o
archeology o
and o
the o
concept o
of o
" o
correlation o
, o
" o
is o
able o
to o
link o
together o
a o
single o
sample o
with o
pieces o
from o
the o
same o
culture o
found o
nearby o
, o
allowing o
him o
to o
draw o
conclusions o
with o
confidence o
and o
to o
bring o
his o
creative o
abilities o
into o
play o
while o
remaining o
true o
to o
the o
original o
. o

Reproducing o
the o
spirit o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o

Stop o
right o
there o
! o

You o
might o
wonder o
: o
If o
he o
is o
making o
reproductions o
, o
how o
can o
he o
bring o
creativity o
into o
it o
? o

Cheng B-PER
's o
response o
is o
this o
: o
" o
I o
think o
that o
the o
original o
potters o
also o
followed o
their o
whims o
and o
improvised o
when o
they o
worked o
, o
and o
did o
n't o
rigidly o
make o
each o
embellishment o
by o
rote o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
considers o
the o
problem o
and o
then o
adds o
: o
" o
I o
not o
only o
want o
to o
reproduce o
the o
appearance o
of o
the o
originals o
, o
but o
also o
the o
spirit o
of o
the o
people o
who o
made o
them o
. o
" o

The o
reconstruction o
of o
an o
Ilan B-GPE
square o
- o
patterned o
pottery o
jar o
found o
by o
Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
in o
the o
town o
of o
Chiushe B-GPE
is o
a o
good o
illustration o
of o
Cheng B-PER
's o
whole o
approach o
. o

Upon o
inspecting o
the o
original o
, o
Cheng B-PER
discovered o
that o
the o
walls o
were o
very o
thin o
. o

If o
the o
decorative o
pattern o
had o
been o
stamped o
on o
after o
the o
clay o
had o
been o
formed o
, o
it o
would o
certainly o
have o
ruined o
the o
shape o
. o

So o
how o
did o
the o
original o
maker o
get o
the o
pattern o
on o
there o
? o

Having o
repeatedly o
thought o
about o
this o
problem o
, o
Cheng B-PER
concluded o
that o
prehistoric o
potters o
must o
have o
used o
an o
internal o
mold o
when o
working o
. o

Perhaps o
they o
had o
shards o
that o
they o
could o
just o
pick o
up o
from o
the o
ground o
around o
them o
. o

They o
could o
take o
the o
kneaded o
clay o
, o
wrap o
it o
on o
the o
outside o
of o
the o
shards o
, o
and o
tap o
it o
down o
lightly o
with o
a o
wooden o
stick o
to o
make o
the o
clay o
more o
compact o
and o
solid o
. o

The o
stick o
would o
have o
patterns o
carved o
into o
it o
which o
would o
then o
be o
left o
imprinted o
on o
the o
clay o
. o

But o
this o
decorative o
effect o
, o
thinks o
Cheng B-PER
, o
was o
probably o
secondary o
to o
the o
functional o
purpose o
of o
compacting o
the o
clay o
. o

With o
these o
ideas o
in o
mind o
, o
Cheng B-PER
first o
ground o
up o
a o
handful o
of o
gravel o
, o
added o
it o
to o
the o
clay o
, o
and o
kneaded o
it o
vigorously o
. o

Then o
he o
took o
a o
mold o
that o
had o
been o
made o
from o
the o
original o
sample o
, o
and o
spread o
the o
clay o
- o
now o
with o
the o
texture o
of o
pizza o
dough o
- o
on o
the o
outside o
. o

Then o
he o
tapped o
it o
with o
a o
small o
stick o
, o
which o
he o
had o
personally o
prepared o
by o
paring o
off o
the o
bark o
and o
carving o
a o
pattern o
of o
squares o
into o
the o
wood o
. o

Next o
he o
cut o
away o
the o
bottom o
of o
the o
jar o
and o
carefully o
removed o
it o
. o

He o
repeated o
the o
process o
to o
make o
the o
top o
section o
, o
then o
connected o
the o
upper o
and o
lower o
parts o
. o

Then o
, o
with o
his o
right o
hand o
he o
picked o
up o
the o
wood o
stick o
and o
tapped o
around o
the o
outside o
, o
while o
with o
his o
left o
he o
held o
a o
mushroom o
- o
shaped o
object o
against o
the o
inside o
of o
the o
jar o
to o
absorb o
the o
shock o
and o
prevent o
the o
jar o
from o
collapsing o
inward o
. o

A o
careful o
examination o
of o
the o
finished o
jar o
- o
with o
its o
square o
pattern o
already o
imprinted o
- o
showed o
it o
to o
look o
exactly o
like o
the o
sample o
in o
the o
photo o
. o

Dialogue o
with o
academia o

To o
reconstruct o
these o
36 o
pieces o
of o
pottery o
, o
as o
much o
as o
he o
could o
Cheng B-PER
used o
the o
same o
tools o
as o
were o
available o
to o
their o
original o
makers o
. o

In o
particular o
, o
he o
avoided o
using o
any o
iron o
implements o
, o
since o
none o
had o
been o
available o
back o
then o
. o

When o
making o
the o
ceramic o
boar o
, o
he o
went o
into o
the o
bamboo o
forest o
in o
front o
of o
his o
house o
and o
cut o
off o
bamboo o
branches o
by o
hand o
to o
serve o
as o
the o
pig o
's o
nostrils o
. o

When o
there o
were o
no o
ready o
- o
made o
tools o
available o
, o
he o
made o
his o
own o
, o
such o
as o
the o
above o
- o
mentioned o
" o
mushroom o
head o
. o
" o

" o
Such o
a o
' o
mushroom o
head o
' o
was o
unearthed o
at o
the o
Peinan o
site o
, o
" o
says o
Cheng B-PER
, o
" o
and o
archeologists o
had o
no o
idea o
what o
it o
was o
for o
. o

But o
people o
like o
me o
who o
make o
pottery o
can o
identify o
its o
function o
with o
one o
look o
. o
" o

Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
states o
that o
his o
conversations o
with o
Cheng B-PER
have o
given o
him o
much o
food o
for o
thought o
and o
allowed o
him o
to o
more o
accurately o
visualize o
the o
lifestyles o
and o
technology o
of o
prehistoric o
peoples o
. o

" o
We o
help o
each o
other o
a o
lot o
. o
" o

For o
instance o
, o
Cheng B-PER
has o
brought o
his o
ceramicist o
's o
mind o
's o
eye o
to o
bear o
on o
the o
mystery o
of o
why o
gravel o
was o
mixed o
into o
prehistoric o
pottery o
. o

In o
virtually o
all o
archeological o
reports o
, o
prehistoric o
pottery o
includes o
gravel o
, o
usually o
at o
a o
level o
of o
25 o
- o
30 o
% o
. o

Some o
also o
includes o
shells o
or o
hornblende o
. o

This o
is o
definitely o
not o
because o
prehistoric o
people o
were o
unable o
to o
get o
clay o
of o
greater o
purity o
. o

On o
the o
contrary o
, o
the o
clay o
they o
used o
was o
often o
of o
higher o
quality o
than o
clay o
today o
. o

Thus o
Cheng B-PER
concludes o
that o
the o
inclusion o
of o
gravel o
must o
have o
been o
deliberate o
. o

Cheng B-PER
explains o
: o
" o
These o
days o
most o
ceramic o
artists o
buy o
factory o
- o
produced o
clay o
that o
meets o
a o
certain o
set o
of o
specifications o
. o

Rarely o
would o
anybody o
add o
gravel o
. o

After o
all o
, o
everybody o
uses o
electric o
kilns o
, o
because o
they o
offer o
precise o
temperature o
control o
, o
so o
their o
pieces o
can o
be o
fired o
slowly o
, o
with o
no o
risk o
of o
cracking o
from o
overly o
rapid o
heating o
or o
cooling o
. o
" o

Prehistoric o
wisdom o

But o
prehistoric o
peoples o
did o
not o
possess o
any o
of o
these o
things o
. o

They o
had o
to o
dig o
, o
rinse o
, o
and o
filter o
their o
own o
clay o
, o
shape o
the o
pieces o
, o
then o
fire o
them o
all o
together o
in o
a o
big o
pile o
of o
wood o
under o
the o
open o
sky o
. o

This o
is o
why o
they o
added o
gravel o
to o
the o
clay o
, o
liking o
mixing o
stones o
into o
mud o
, o
to o
increase o
its o
strength o
and o
so o
avoid o
having o
the o
pottery o
fracture o
as o
it o
first o
expanded o
under o
the o
heat o
and o
then o
contracted o
as o
it o
cooled o
. o

From o
this o
we o
can o
see o
, o
affirms o
Cheng B-PER
, o
that o
" o
prehistoric o
people o
understood o
how o
to o
use o
mixed o
materials o
, o
which o
was o
a o
major o
breakthrough o
in o
technique o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
found o
further o
indirect o
confirmation o
of o
his o
judgement o
about o
the o
technical o
skills o
possessed o
by o
prehistoric o
makers o
of o
pottery o
from o
a o
documentary o
on o
Japan B-GPE
's o
NHK B-ORG
network o
. o

In o
the o
film o
, o
a o
Japanese o
ceramic o
artist o
, o
an o
individual o
who o
is o
considered o
a o
" o
national o
treasure o
" o
of o
Japan B-GPE
, o
goes o
to o
visit o
a o
small o
island o
in o
Indonesia B-GPE
where o
everybody o
makes o
pottery o
. o

When o
he o
arrives o
there o
, o
this o
great o
master o
becomes o
more o
like o
a o
youthful o
acolyte o
. o

As o
the o
Japanese o
ceramicist o
slowly o
and o
steadily o
works o
the o
clay o
at o
his o
wheel o
, o
an o
elderly o
aboriginal o
woman o
working o
next o
to o
him o
just o
turns o
the o
wheel o
twice o
with o
her o
feet o
and o
shapes o
a o
finished o
ceramic o
jug o
. o

The o
ability o
of o
the o
indigenous o
people o
on o
this o
small o
island o
to o
judge o
the o
quality o
of o
clay o
was o
even o
more o
impressive o
. o

" o
They o
just o
toss o
some o
clay o
into o
their o
mouths o
and o
chew o
it o
around o
for o
a o
while o
, o
and o
they o
know o
whether o
it o
is o
good o
material o
or o
not o
. o

When o
we o
buy o
clay o
, o
the o
first o
thing o
we o
look o
at o
is o
the o
written o
specifications o
, o
" o
says o
Cheng B-PER
with o
a o
laugh o
. o

Firebrand o

Though o
Cheng B-PER
was o
able o
to o
complete o
the o
full o
set o
of o
prehistoric o
pottery o
reproductions o
requested o
by o
the o
museum o
, o
and o
at o
a o
level o
of o
quality o
that o
received o
high o
grades o
from o
the o
museum o
and o
from o
consultant o
Liu B-PER
I I-PER
- I-PER
chang I-PER
, o
Cheng B-PER
himself o
still o
feels o
there o
are o
things o
that o
he o
could o
have o
done o
better o
. o

" o
The o
hardest o
part o
was o
getting o
the o
final o
color o
and o
texture o
of o
the o
originals o
to o
come o
through o
in o
the o
reproductions o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
relates o
that o
in o
this o
regard o
there o
were o
some o
factors o
he o
could o
manipulate o
, o
but o
others o
that o
were o
beyond o
his o
control o
. o

" o
What o
kind o
of o
clay o
did o
prehistoric o
people o
use o
? o

At o
what o
temperature o
did o
they o
fire o
the o
pots o
? o

You o
do o
n't o
get o
the o
same o
feeling o
from o
artifacts o
that o
have o
been o
buried o
in o
the o
ground o
for o
thousands o
of o
years o
, o
exposed o
to o
microbes o
and o
chemical o
transformations o
, o
that o
you o
can o
get o
instantly o
from o
the o
recreated o
works o
that o
I o
am o
doing o
today o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
admits o
that o
if o
he o
utilized o
extraneous o
processes o
, o
such o
as o
exposing o
the o
pieces o
to o
wood o
smoke o
for o
a o
long o
time o
, o
he o
could o
get o
the o
colors o
closer o
to o
those o
of o
the o
actual o
artifacts o
, o
but o
then o
he o
would o
be o
losing o
something o
else o
at o
the o
same o
time o
. o

Thus o
, o
before o
getting o
down o
to o
work o
on o
the o
final o
version o
of o
each o
piece o
, o
he o
made o
numerous o
trials o
, o
using o
different o
proportions o
of o
iron o
oxide o
, o
trying o
different o
temperatures o
, o
sometimes o
buffing o
the o
piece o
to o
make o
it o
glossy o
and o
other o
times o
not o
, o
to o
get o
as o
close o
as o
possible o
to o
the o
correct o
overall o
effect o
. o

And o
then o
of o
course o
there o
was o
the o
problem o
that o
the o
pottery o
- o
making o
process o
in o
prehistoric o
times o
was o
markedly o
different o
from o
the o
modern o
procedure o
. o

" o
These o
days o
we o
use o
electric o
kilns o
. o

Though o
they o
are o
safer o
, o
they o
do o
not o
leave o
the o
same o
traces o
that o
prehistoric o
pottery o
has o
from o
being o
fired o
outdoors o
with o
uneven o
exposure o
to o
the o
heat o
. o
" o

Cheng B-PER
feels o
very o
strongly o
about o
this o
. o

In o
Western o
mythology o
, o
man o
escaped o
the o
fate o
of o
the o
other o
animals o
by o
stealing o
fire o
from o
the o
gods o
, o
and o
it o
was o
fire o
that o
allowed o
the o
rise o
of o
bronze o
- o
age o
civilization o
and o
pottery o
cultures o
. o

But o
now o
, o
fire o
has o
been o
taken o
offstage o
, o
and o
replaced o
by o
electricity o
. o

The o
relationship o
between o
fire o
and o
potters o
has o
been o
severed o
by o
modern o
kilns o
. o

" o
There o
is o
only o
the o
moment o
when o
you o
turn o
on o
the o
power o
- o
click o
- o
there o
is o
no o
physical o
sensation o
of o
kindling o
wood o
or o
smoke o
. o
" o

Back o
to o
the o
tribal o
experience o

After o
mulling o
over o
his o
experiences o
, o
Cheng B-PER
decided o
that o
he o
is o
going o
to o
save o
up o
money o
to o
build o
the o
finest o
wood o
- o
fire o
pottery o
kiln o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

This o
could o
not o
only o
restore o
the o
relationship o
between o
fire o
and o
potter o
, o
but o
could o
also o
induce o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
ceramic o
artists o
- o
among o
whom o
Cheng B-PER
believes o
there o
is o
currently o
too o
much o
division o
and o
distance o
- o
to o
cooperate o
with o
each o
other o
. o

" o
This o
could o
encourage o
interaction o
and o
partnership o
, o
and o
even o
in o
a o
small o
way o
create o
a o
sense o
of o
having o
returned o
to o
the o
tribal o
village o
. o
" o

Now o
that o
's o
a o
lovely o
thought o
. o

The o
human o
tradition o
of o
eating o
snakes o
and o
using o
snakes o
for o
medicinal o
purposes o
goes o
back o
a o
long o
way o
. o

In o
subtropical o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
with o
its o
many o
native o
snakes o
, o
there o
were o
once o
snake o
research o
institutes o

Most o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
venomous o
snakes o
live o
in o
low o
- o
altitude o
farmland o
and o
sparsely o
populated o
countryside o
. o

But o
the o
hundred o
- o
pace o
viper o
, o
which o
was o
never o
very o
numerous o
, o
is o
at o
home o
in o
densely o
forested o
areas o
at o
low o
to o
medium o
elevations o
in o
the o
mountains o
of o
eastern o

more o

much o
the o
same o
length o
as o

cobra o
- o
but o
being o
far o
thicker o
and o
meatier o
it o
is o
much o
valued o
by o
gourmands o
. o

Since o
the o
snake o
is o
also o
sought o
after o
for o
its o
venom o
, o
it o
commands o
tremendously o
high o
prices o

began o
studying o
poisonous o
snakes o
, o
and o
started o
a o
trend o
of o
research o
into o
snake o
venom o
antiserums o
. o

Snake o
venoms o
contain o
complex o
combinations o
of o
enzymes o
, o
and o
as o
well o
as o
being o
useful o
for o
the o
treatment o
of o
snakebite o
, o
they o
have o
also o
been o
used o
as o
the o
basis o
for o
developing o
many o
new o
medical o
drugs o
such o
as o
anticoagulants o
and o
anesthetics o
. o

But o
due o
to o
their o
complexity o
, o
snake o
venoms o
are o
not o
easily o
synthesized o
, o
so o
they o
have o
to o
be o
milked o
directly o
from o
snakes o
. o

According o
to o
medical o
records o
of o
the o
time o
the o
hundred o
- o
pace o
viper o
caused o
more o
deaths o
than o
any o
other o
Taiwanese o
snake o
, o
so o
it o
became o
an o
important o
research o
topic o
. o

Lavuras B-PER
recalls o
that o
the o
largest o
numbers o
of o
hundred o

pace o
vipers o
were o
caught o
in o
the o
period o
from o
the o
1960s o
to o
the o
1980s o
. o

As o
the o
fingers o
of o
development o
pushed o
up o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
mountains o
and o
forests o
, o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
were o
forced o
into o
retreat o
everywhere o
, o
and o
in o
1989 o
the B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of I-ORG
Agriculture I-ORG
put o
the o
snake o
on o
the o

Since o

the o

of o

has o
gradually o

But o
is o
the o
hundred o

really o
the o
most o
fearsome o
cold o

killer o
of o
all o
Taiwan B-GPE

Chen B-PER

, o
a o

states o
that o
among o

" o
top o
five o
" o
poisonous o
snakes o
, o
the o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
in o
fact o
has o
the o
weakest o
venom o
. o

But o
its o
fangs o
are o
especially o
long o
, o
and o
it o
secretes o
the o
largest o
quantity o
of o
venom o
of o
any o
Taiwanese o
snake o
. o

However o
, o
the o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
lives o
in o
the o
dark o
depths o
of o
the o
dense o
jungle o
, o
and o
its o
numbers o
are o
relatively o
small o
. o

Not o
only o
does o
it o
take o
a o
goodly o
portion o
of o
luck o
for o
a o
snake o
hunter o
to o
find o
a o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
- o
the o
number o
of o
people o
unfortunate o
enough o
to o
be o
bitten o
by o
one o
is o
also o
very o
small o
. o

One o
mountain o
lover o
who o
often o
encounters o
snakes o
on o
his o
hiking o
expeditions o
describes o
the o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
as o
" o
cool o
, o
calm o
and o
collected o
, o
" o
and o
people o
who o
have o
kept o
or o
observed o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
also o
say o
they o
" o
do o
n't o
lash o
out o
blindly o

" o

Hu B-PER

describes o
them o
as o
" o
really o
the o
chieftain o
among o
snakes o
- o
they o
have o
a o
serene o
, o
tolerant o
nature o
, o
and o
are o
not o
apt o
to o
attack o
people o
wantonly o
. o
" o

Perhaps o
it o
is o
because o
of o
this o
regal o
temperament o
that o
they o
are o
revered o
as o
ancestral o
spirits o
by o
the o
Paiwan o
. o

The o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
belongs o
to o
the o
viper o
family o
, o
which o
was o
the o
last o
of o
the o
snake o
families o
to o
evolve o
. o

Unlike o
the o
more o
primitive o
pythons o

, o
the o
vipers o
all o
have o
venom o

explains o
that o

evolved o
from o

dwelling o
animals o
, o
and o
lacking o
limbs o
, o
they o
are o
less o
agile o
than o
most o

. o

Their o
vision o
and o
hearing o
are o
also o
poor o
. o

Hence o
their o
poison o
fangs o
are o
almost o
the o
only o
tools o
they o
have o
to o

and o
defend o
themselves o
with o

In o

, o
which o
is o
endemic o
to o

of o

, o
curator o
of o
the o
zoo o
's o
rescue o

for o

says o
that o
the o
year o
before o
last o
there o
were o
six o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
in o
the o
rescue o
center o
which o
had o
been o
confiscated o
from o
a o
snake o
shop o
in o
Panchiao B-GPE
. o

Zoo o
staff o
felt o
that o
not o
enough o
was o
known o
about o
the o
snakes o
' o
habits o
for o
them o
to o
be o
successfully o
released o
back o
into o
the o
wild o
, o
and o
in o
order o
to o
have o
some o
substantive o
educational o
content o
to o
show o
visitors o
, o
they o
decided o
to o
start o
a o
breeding o
program o
. o

Lin B-PER

says o
that o
as o
far o
as o
is o
known o
from o
observation o
of o
snakes o
in o
the o
wild o
, o
they o
live o
largely o
solitary o
lives o
. o

Their o
sense o
of o
smell o
is o
an o
important o
means o
of o
communication o
, o
and o
in o
the o
breeding o
season o
male o
snakes o
are o
attracted o
by o
scents o
released o
by o
the o
females o
. o

In o
late o
October o
1999 o
, o
the o
zoo o
began o
putting o
the o
male o
and o
female o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
together o
in o
pairs o
, o
and o
one o
pair o
took o
a o
liking o
to o
each o
other o
. o

The o
male o
gently o
courted o
the o
female o
by o
licking o
her o
head o
with o
his o
tongue o
. o

For o
the o
next o
three o
weeks o
the o
couple o
were o
inseparable o
, o
after o
which o
they o
gradually o
returned o
to o
their o
solitary o
lifestyles o
. o

In o
February o
of o
last o
year o
, o
the o
female o
snake o
's o
belly o
gradually o
began o
to o
swell o
, o
and o
an o
ultrasound o
examination o
confirmed o
she o
was o
pregnant o
. o

In o
the o
two o
weeks o
after o
she o
laid o
her o
eggs o
, o
the o
female o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
protected o
them o
vigorously o
. o

Not o
daring o
to o
anger o
her o
, o
the o
zoo o
staff o
waited o
for o
her o
maternal o
instincts o
to o
subside o
somewhat o
before o
removing o
the o
eggs o
. o

In o
August o
last o
year o
, o
as o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
being o
buffeted o
by o
a o
typhoon o
, o
over o
20 o
eggs o
hatched o
out o
into o
tiny o
snakes o
, o
which o
the o
zoo o
hopes o
can o
grow o
up o
safe o
and o
sound o
. o

During o
this o
first o
breeding o
session o
, o
for o
fear o
of o
anything o
going o
wrong o
with o
the o
pregnancy o
the o
zoo o
staff o
disturbed o
the o
mother o
snake o
as o
little o
as o
possible o
. o

But o
Lin B-PER
Hua I-PER
- I-PER
ching I-PER
says o
that o
next o
time o
around o
they o
will o
gather o
more o
detailed o
data o
, o
such o
as o
weighing o
the o
female o
snake o
every o
week o
, o
to o
make o
a o
comprehensive o
record o
of o
the o
breeding o
process o
. o

Hear o
the o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
's o
voice o

However o
, o
no o
matter o
how o
many o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
we o
can o
see o
at o
the o
zoo o
on o
future o
visits o
, o
it o
is o
obvious o
that o
we o
can o
not o
fully o
understand o
them o
just o
by o
seeing o
them o
in o
captivity o
. o

When o
Lavuras B-PER
mentioned o
at o
a o
Symposium o
on o
Amphibian o
and o
Reptile o
Ecology o
and o
Conservation o
held o
by o
Taipei B-ORG
Zoo I-ORG
last o
year o
that o
the o
Paiwan o
used o
their o
nose o
- o
flutes o
to o
imitate o
the o
voice o
of o
the o
hundred o
- o
pace o
viper o
, o
all o
the o
biologists o
present o
said o
they o
had o
never o
heard o
a o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
make o
a o
sound o
. o

Lavuras B-PER
asked o
the o
scholars o
bluntly o
where o
they o
had o
seen o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
. o

If o
it o
was o
in o
the o
zoo o
, o
the o
snakes o
were o
away o
from o
their o
natural o
environment o
. o

But o
even o
if o
it o
was o
in o
the o
wild o
, o
with o
the o
great o
environmental o
changes o
of o
modern o
times o
the o
snakes o
might o
have o
been o
" o
struck o
dumb o
" o
too o
! o

Whether o
hundred o
- o
pacers o
really o
do o
have o
a o
voice o
is o
an o
unanswered o
question o
of o
biology o
. o

But o
perhaps o
the o
aborigines o
' o
open o
attitude o
toward o
and o
involvement o
in o
the o
natural o
world o
, o
as o
revealed o
in o
their o
legend o
of o
the o
nose o
flute o
, o
is o
something o
even o
harder o
to o
imagine o
for o
modern o
people o
who o
received o
a o
rationalist o
education o
and o
operate o
in o
a o
mechanized o
culture o
. o

Perhaps o
in o
this o
Year o
of o
the o
Snake o
, o
the o
hundred o
- o
pacer o
, o
just o
like o
the o
Paiwan o
people o
who o
also o
still o
live o
in o
close o
communion o
with o
nature o
, o
is o
singing o
us o
some o
long o
- o
forgotten o
songs o
of o

- o
if o
only o
you o
are o
willing o
to o
listen o
with o
your o

A o
Mrs. o
Wei B-PER
, o
who o
chose o
to o
leave o
her o
job o
as o
a o
bookkeeper o
five o
years o
ago o
because o
of o
an o
unexpected o
pregnancy o
, o
thought o
at o
the o
time o
that o
with o
her o
ability o
, o
experience o
and o
contacts o
it o
would o
not o
be o
hard o
for o
her o
to o
find o
a o
new o
job o
once o
her o
child o
started o

school o
. o

But o
as o
the o
day o
of o
her o
return o
to o
the o
world o
of o
work o
draws o
ever o
nearer o
, o
she o
feels o
a o
growing o
sense o
of o
panic o
. o

" o
Most o
of o
my o
old o
colleagues o
have o
left o
, o
and o
the o
few o
I o
'm o
still o
in o

with o

about o
nothing o

things o
like o
Excel o

that o
I o
know o
nothing o
about o
! o
" o

Mrs. o
Wei B-PER
has o
hinted o
a o
few o
times o
to o
her o
husband o
that o
she o
should o
just o
stay o
at o
home o
and o
concentrate o
on o
looking o
after o
the o
children o
. o

But o
thinking o
of o
her o
husband o
's o
grim o
expression o
whenever o
he o
gives o
her o
the o
housekeeping o
money o
, o
she o
does o
n't o
dare o
to o
say o
it o
plainly o
. o

In o
today o
's o
society o
, o
youth o
is o
beauty o
. o

But o
in o
trying o
to o
show o
he o
was o
not o
out o
of o
touch o
with o
youth o
, o
Mr. o
Chou B-PER
, o
the o
45 o
- o
year o
- o
old o
boss o
of o
a o
computer o
components o
company o
, o
had o
an o
experience o
which o
left o
him o
not o
knowing o
whether o
to o
laugh o
or o
cry o
. o

He o
arranged o
with o
his o
young o
employees o
to o
go o
for o
a o
barbecue o
in o
a o
river o
valley o
, o
hoping o
to o
get o
to o
know o
them o
better o
. o

But o
when o
they o
arrived o
there o
, o
the o
workers o
formed o
their o
own o
groups o
, o
laughing o
and o
clowning o
around o
, o
and o
left o
him o
to o
get o
on o
with o
barbecuing o
the o
meat o
. o

When o
it o
was o
done o
- o
and o
he o
was o
drenched o
in o
sweat o
- o
the o
young o
people o
, o
attracted o
by o
the o
aroma o
, o
gathered o
round o
. o

But o
after o
giving o
him o
a o
few o
words o
of o
praise o
, o
they o
wolfed o
down o
the o
food o
and o
scattered o
again o
immediately o
, o
as o
if o
he o
did o
n't o
even o
exist o
. o

" o
They o
probably o
thought o
their o
old o
fogey o
of o
a o
boss o
had o
just o
come o
to o
wait o
on o
them o
! o
" o

From o
then o
on o
Mr. o
Chou B-PER
, o
having o
recognized o
his o
own o
place o
in o
the o
order o
of o
things o
, o
made o
no o
more o
attempts o
to o
ingratiate o
himself o
with o
his o
young o
employees o
- o
and o
in o
fact o
felt o
much o
the o
more o
relaxed o
for o
it o
. o

More o
crises o
in o
middle o
age o
? o

" o
By o
middle o
age o
, o
you o
have o
more o
experience o
of o
life o
, o
and o
you o
are o
sure o
to o
have o
various o
realizations o
and o
regrets o
, o
" o

Even o
if o
you o
have o
no o
economic o
worries o
and o
as o
yet o
no o
health o
problems o
, o
nonetheless o
the o
flowing o
river o
of o
life o
has o
carried o
away o
your o
youth o
, o
ideals o
, o
pure o
love o
and o
even o
your o
loved o
ones o
, o
and o
left o
you o
with o
many o
wounds o
you o
are o
loth o
to o
touch o
and o
regrets o
you o
are o
loth o
to o
remember o
. o

The o
sense o
that o
the o
realization o
of o
past o
mistakes o
has o
come o
too o
late o
to o
put o
them o
right o
, o
and o
of o
your o
remaining o

, o
makes o
you o
feel o

need o

became o
the o
first o
scholar o
to o
promote o
" o
male o
studies o
" o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
offers o
the o
following o
analysis o
: o

The o
real o
reason o
why o
the o
" o
midlife o
crisis o
" o
has o
become o
such o
a o
hot o
topic o
in o
the o
US B-GPE
lies o
with o
the o
75 o
million o
" o
baby o
boomers o
" o
born o
in o
the o
postwar o
period o
from o
1946 o
to o
1964 o
. o

One o
can o
say o
that o
this o
huge o
generation o
is o
the o
one o
with o
the o
highest o
level o
of o
achievement o
, o
and o
the o
most o
diverse o
set o
of o
values o
, o
in o
human o
history o
. o

Since o
they o
gradually o
began o
to o
enter o
middle o
age o
in o
the o
late o
1980s o
, o
they o
have o
produced o
many o
reminiscences o
and o
introspective o
works o
about o
their o
own o
mental o
and o
spiritual o
journey o
, o
which o
have o
elicited o
a o
strong o
response o
. o

The o
US B-GPE
's o
present o
middle o
- o
aged o
generation o
have o
metamorphosed o
from o
youthful o
anti-war o
protesters o
and o
hippies o
into o
yuppie o
managers o
of o
multinational o
corporations o
, o
and o
from o
idealists o
into o
materialists o
. o

The o
tensions o
and o
trauma o
of o
that o
transformation o
cause o
their o
" o
midlife o
crisis o
" o
to o
be o
especially o
complex o
. o

By o
contrast o
, o
although o
Taiwan B-GPE
had o
its o
own o
baby o
boom o
from o
1951 o
to o
1966 o
, o
its o
middle o
- o
aged o
generation o
have o
not o
had o
the o
same o
life o
experiences o
, o
so o
while o
they o
too o
have o
their o
midlife o
crises o
, o
they o
are o
much o
less o
complex o
. o

Lu I-PER
, o

, o
suggests o
that o
" o
change o
" o
would o
be o
a o
better o
term o
than o
" o
crisis o
" o
for o
the o
mood o
swings o
and o
difficulties o
of o
middle o
age o
. o

Midlife o
change o
, o
in o
fact o
, o
is o
a o
natural o
process o
in o
the o
journey o
of o
life o
, o
and o
as o
people o
grow o
older o
and o
have o
to o
shoulder o
ever o
heavier o
responsibilities o
, o
all o
kinds o
of o
pressures o
large o
and o
small o
appear o
together o
at o
this o
time o
of o
life o
. o

For o
example o
, o
says o
Lu B-PER
, o
middle o
- o
aged o
people o
are o
the o
meat o
in o
a o
generational o
sandwich o
. o

Their o
aging o
parents o
increasingly o
need o
care o
, o
while o
at o
the o
same o
time o
their o
teenage o
children o
are o
at o
their o
most o
rebellious o
. o

Other o
elements o
in o
their o
lives o
, o
such o
as o
their o
job o
or o
marriage o
, o
have o
been o
in o
existence o
for o
ten o
to o
20 o
years o
; o
the o
sparkle o
is o
gone o
, o
yet o
they o
have o
invested o
too o
much o
to o
just o
walk o
away o
from o
them o
. o

And o
again o
, o
turning o
to o
look o
at o
themselves o
, o
gray o
hairs o
are o
sprouting o
from o
their o
temples o
and o
crows o
' o
feet o
appearing o
at o
the o
corners o
of o
their o
eyes o
, o
their o
jowls o
are o
sagging o
, o
and o
the o
thick o
, o
solid o
chest o
muscles o
of o
their o
youth o
have o
somehow o
migrated o
down o
to o
their o
bellies o
. o

When o
they o
take o
their o
sons o
out o
for o
some o
exercise o
, o
they o
do o
n't o
even o
have o
the o
strength o
to o
do o
a o
single o
pull o
- o
up o
! o

Midlife o
brings o
many o
uncertainties o
, o
and o
if o
it o
comes o
in o
a o
time o
of o
dramatic o
social o
change o
when o
many o
role o
models o
are o
being o
completely o
rewritten o
, o
middle o
- o
aged o
people o
may o
be o
left o
even o
more o
at o
a o
loss o
. o

Life o
is o
long o
, o
the o
future o
bleak o

notes o
that o
firstly o
, o
life o
expectancy o
has o
rapidly o
increased o
. o

In o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
average o
life o
expectancy o
has o
risen o
steadily o
from o
55 o
years o
in o
1951 o
to o
75 o
today o
. o

As o
the o
journey o
of o
life o
lengthens o
, o
middle o
- o
aged o
people o
become o
more o
and o
more o
confused o
about o
their o
status o
in o
life o
. o

A o
Mr. o
Chang B-PER
, o
who o
lives o
in o
Hualien B-GPE
, o
is o
now o
58 o
, o
nearing o
the o
upper o
end o
of o
middle o
age o
. o

He o
recalls o
that o
when o
he o
saw o
his o
parents o
at o
age o
60 o
he o
thought o
they o
were o
" o
ever o
so o
old o
, o
" o
and o
they o
seemed o
quite o
content o
to o
dandle o
their o
grandchildren o
, o
oblivious o
to o
the o
affairs o
of o
the o
world o
. o

But o
now o
that o
he o
is o
approaching o
the o
same o
age o
himself o
, o
he o
feels o
he o
is o
not o
yet o
qualified o
to o
call o
himself o
old o
, o
and o
still o
less o
to o
speak o
lightly o
of o
retiring o
. o

" o
We o
're o
living o
longer o
, o
but o
life o
is o
more o
tiring o
! o
" o

He o
asks o
, o
only o
half o
in o
jest o
: o
How o
come o
nowadays o
middle o
age o
seems o
to o
drag o
on o
forever o
? o

With o
longer o
lifespans o
and o
less o
rigid o
social o
values o
, o
patterns o
of o
living o
once o
shared o
by o
all o
have o
been o
replaced o
by o
a o
growing o
diversity o
of o
individual o
experiences o
. o

In o
middle o
age o
, o
some o
people o
set o
up o
successful o
businesses o
, o
while o
others o
lose o
their o
jobs o
and o
are o
faced o
with o
poverty o
; o
working o
women o
find o
themselves o
squeezed o
between o
the o
exhausting o
demands o
of o
children o
and o
housework o
on o
the o
one o
hand o
and o
their o
jobs o
on o
the o
other o
, o
while o
at o
the o
same o
time o
many o
single o
women o
face o
a o
daily o
battle o
with o
loneliness o
. o

At o
the o
age o
of o
50 B-PER
, o
some o
people o
already o
have o
grandchildren o
at o
their o
knee o
, o
while o
others o
are o
getting o

for o
the o

With o

of o

the o

At o
the o

a o
scene o
at o

The o

of o

" o
Actually o
, o
it o
's o
not o
as o
if o
I o
did o
n't o
have o
my o
suspicions o
all o
those o
years o
. o

But o
I o
never o
thought o
things o
would o
turn o
out o
so o
awful o
! o

How o
could o
I o
have o
been o
such o
a o

For o

next o
six o

could o
hardly o
sleep o
or o

By o
day o
she o
dragged o
herself o
to o
work o
like o
a o
zombie o
, o
but o
in o
the o
middle o
of o
the o
night o
she o
would o
wake o
with o
a o
start o
, o
her o
heart o
pounding o
so o
hard o
she o
could o
n't o
breathe o
. o

The o
affair o
finally o
ended o
in o

, o
but o
the o
upside o
is o
that o
since o
then o
her o
ex o
has o
actually o
behaved o
better o
, o
for o
he o
has o
begun o
to o

every o

and o
is o
much o

than o
before o

At o

they o

that o

by o
the o

Life o
in o

with o
an o

of o

that o
if o
a o

the o
whole o

away o
, o
the o

of o

mother o
often o
comes o
to o
stay o
, o
and o
this o
has o
done o
much o
to o
lighten o
the o
burden o
of o
running o
her o
household o
. o

But o
many o
people o
who o
arrive o
in o
middle o

without o
the o
support o
of o
a o
family o
can o
only o
try o
to o
weather o
life o
's o
storms o
alone o
. o

Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
, o
still o
single o
at o
46 o
, o
is o
an o
example o
. o

When o
she o
worked o
as o
a o
PR o
manager o
for o
foreign o
companies o
such o
as o
Hewlett B-ORG
- I-ORG
Packard I-ORG
and o
Texas B-ORG
Instruments I-ORG
, o
she o
was o
always o
the o
highly o
effective o
superwoman o
. o

But o
she o
realized o
that o
under o
the o
dual o
pressure o
of o
her o
need o
for o
career o
success o
and o
her o
unfulfilled o
emotional o
needs o
, o
she o
was o
approaching o
a o
state o
of o
psychological o
collapse o
. o

Two o
years o
ago o
, o
she o
became o
seriously o
depressed o
. o

At o
night o
she o
would o
toss o
and o
turn o
in o
bed o
, o
but o
the o
worry o
that o
lack o
of o
sleep o
would o
make o
her o
unable o
to o
get o
up o
in o
the o
morning o
and o
would o
affect o
her o
work o
performance o
made o
her o
even o
less o
able o
to o
sleep o
. o

Years o
of o
looking o
at o
a o
computer o
screen o
was o
causing o
her o
vision o
to o
deteriorate o
rapidly o
, o
and o
due o
to o
working o
in o
a o
sealed o
high o
- o
tech o
office o
she o
was o
always o
dogged o
by o
colds o
, o
so o
that o
every o
day o
she o
felt o
under o
the o
weather o
. o

Live o
for o
today o

" o
I o
asked o
myself o
, o
do o
you o
really o
want o
to o
carry o
on o
like o
this o
? o

What o
matters o
more o
, o
your o
work o
or o
your o
health o
? o
" o

Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
had o
accumulated o
some o
savings o
during o
her o
many o
years o
at o
work o
, o
but o
for o
the o
first o
three o
months o
after o
she o
resigned o
her o
job o
she o
could o
not o
help o
a o
sense o
of o
panic o
, o
feeling o
anxious o
that o
she o
might o
be o
cast o
out o
by o
society o
, o
and o
also o
fearing o
the o
accusing o
looks o
of o
her o
friends o
and o
family o
. o

But o
gradually o
she o
began o
to o
learn o
to o
relax o
and o
let o
go o
. o

" o
Zhuangzi B-PER
says o
that o
life o
is o
toil o
and o
that o
death o
is o
the o
time o
for o
rest o
, o
but o
I o
do o
n't o
believe o
all o
that o
. o

It o
should o
n't o
be o
that o
way o
! o
" o

After o
three o
months o
, o
Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
no o
longer o
put o
herself o
under o
pressure o
, o
and o
no o
longer o
got o
worked o
up o
about o
other o
people o
's o
well o
- o
meaning o
advice o
. o

Once o
she o
stopped o
having o
to o
get o
up o
early o
to o
go o
to o
work o
, o
her o
anxiety o
about o
insomnia o
decreased o
greatly o
, o
and o
when o
she o
was o
able o
to o
adjust o
her o
living o
habits o
according o
to o
her o
own o
needs o
, o
her o
depression o
cleared o
up o
by o
itself o
. o

She o
began o
decorating o
her o
flat o
, o
going o
to o
the o
gym o
, o
and o
cooking o
the o
food o
she o
likes o
, o
and o
even o
just o
sitting o
lost o
in o
thought o
, o
enjoying o
the o
empty o
spaces o
in o
life o
. o

In o
particular o
, o
having o
freed o
herself o
from o
the o
barren o
existence o
of o
a o
" o
sexless o
wage o
slave o
" o
she o
has o
begun o
to o
liberate o
her o
emotional o
side o
and o
enjoy o
the o
pleasure o
of o
being o
a o
woman o
. o

On o
the o
subject o
of o
family o
affection o
and o
affairs o
of o
the o
heart o
, o
Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
has o
also o
come o
to o
a o
realization o
. o

" o
My o
mother o
died o
young o
, o
and o
my o
father o
always o
regarded o
us o
three o
children o
as o
bloodsuckers o
, o
and o
never o
showed o
us o
any o
love o
. o
" o

Because o
of o
this o
, o
Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
left o
home o
early o
to o
live o
independently o
. o

But o
in o
her o
heart o
, o
her o
desire o
for o
love o
has o
never o
ceased o
. o

Perhaps o
the o
shadow o
of o
her o
childhood o
is o
behind o
the o
setbacks o
in o
her o
love o
life o
, o
so o
that o
even o
today o
she o
is o
still o
single o
. o

At o
present o
, o
Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
has o
a o
boyfriend o
ten o
years o
her o
junior o
. o

" o
We o
do o
n't o
constrain o
each o
other o
or o
force o
each o
other o
into o
anything o
. o

We o
're o
only o
together o
when o
we o
really o
want o
to o
be o
. o
" o

The o
year o
before o
last o
when o
her o
father o
was o
dangerously o
ill o
, o
he o
constantly o
rang o
his o
children o
, o
begging o
for o
their o
love o
, o
which o
aroused o
both o
her o
sympathy o
and o
her o
disgust o
. o

Having o
seen o
through o
the o
inconstancy o
of o
family o
affection o
and o
romantic o
attachments o
, o
she o
swore o
never o
again o
to o
put o
her o
emotions o
at o
the o
mercy o
of o
others o
. o

She o
wants o
to o
live o
truly o
at o
ease o
and o
without o
being o
tied o
down o
. o

Keeping o
loneliness o
at o
bay o

For o
Ms. o
Chiang B-PER
, o
the o
single o
life o
has o
its o
freedoms o
and o
its o
loneliness o
. o

But o
do o
those o
who o
are o
surrounded o
by o
a o
family o
have o
more o
peace o
of o
mind o
and o
happiness o
? o

For o
the o
last o
two o
years o
Hsiang B-PER
Chi I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
has o
been o
plagued o
with o
capsulitis o
in o
her o
shoulder o
, o
and o
one o
morning o
when o
she o
could o
n't o
manage o
to o
fasten o
her o
bra o
before o
setting o
off o
for o
work o
, o
she o
woke o
up o
her o
son o
, o
a o
university o
student o
, o
to o
help o
her o
. o

But o
her o
son o
said o
banteringly o
: o
" o
You o
old o
women o
really o
are o
a o
pain o
! o
" o

Once o
, o
Ms. o
Hsiang B-PER
asked o
her o
two o
sons o
which o
of o
them o
was o
going o
to o
look o
after o
her o
when o
she o
was o
old o
. o

But o
her o
sons o
tossed o
the o
question o
back o
and o
forth o
and o
finally o
nominated o
their o
rather o
bossy o
seven o
- o
year o
- o
old o
girl o
cousin o
! o

" o
I o
knew o
they o
were o
only o
joking o
, o
but o
I o
could o
n't o
help o
feeling o
sad o
, o
and o
it o
made o
me o
even o
more o
aware o
that o
in o
everything o
you o
can o
only o
rely o
on o
yourself o
. o

Anything o
else o
is o
phony o
! o
" o
says o
Hsiang B-PER
. o

Having o
a o
husband o
and o
children o
, o
her o
mother o
and o
a o
lot o
of o
friends o
and o
relations o
, o
and o
with o
plenty o
to o
do o
, o
Ms. o
Hsiang B-PER
is o
never o
alone o
, o
yet o
she o
can o
not o
help o
feeling o
lonely o
. o

Sometimes o
at o
night o
she o
ca o
n't o
sleep o
and o
gets o
up o
to o
mop o
the o
floor o
. o

For o
a o
time o
she o
even o
started o
playing o
Tetris o
. o

" o
Lying o
in o
bed o
, o
playing o
with o
complete o
concentration o
, o
not o
thinking o
about o
anything o
else o
, o
I o
got o
up o
to o
scores o
of o
tens o
of o
thousands o
of o
points o
! o
" o
she o
says o
, o
finding o
this o
ridiculous o
even o
herself o
. o

" o
Whenever o
I o
notice o
I o
'm o
getting o
down o
, o
I o
start o
looking o
for o
things o
to o
do o
, o
" o
she o
says o
. o

Middle o
age o
is o
a o
minefield o
, o
and o
you o
must o
n't o
fall o
into o
the o
trap o
of o
letting o
yourself o
get o
downhearted o
! o

The o
best o
laid o
plans o

Apart o
from o
those o
to o
do o
with o
health o
, o
marriage o
and o
work o
, o
many o
other o
unexpected o
changes o
may o
occur o
in o
middle o
age o
. o

When o
he o
was o
38 o
, o
Chao B-PER
Ning I-PER
, o
who o
is o
now o
a o
director o
of o
the o
Buddhist o
satellite o
TV o
station o
LTV B-ORG
and o
the o
producer o
of o
many o
Buddhist o
TV o
programs o
, o
was o
invited o
to o
Houston B-GPE
, I-GPE
Texas I-GPE
to o
give o
a o
lecture o
. o

On o
the o
plane o
he o
happened o
to o
meet o
Buddhist o
Master o
Hsingyun B-PER
of o
Foguangshan B-ORG
Temple I-ORG
. o

After o
14 o
hours o
of o
the o
master o
earnestly o
speaking o
to o
him o
about o
the o
principles o
of o
Buddhist o
life o
, o
" o
Even o
a o
stone o
would o
have o
been o
moved o
! o
" o

After o
Chao B-PER
's o
lecture o
in o
Houston B-GPE
was o
over o
, o
he o
immediately o
took o
a o
plane o
to o
Los B-GPE
Angeles I-GPE
and o
went o
to o
Hsi B-ORG
Lai I-ORG
Temple I-ORG
, o
which o
was o
just o
being o
built o
. o

There o
he o
sought o
out o
Master o
Hsingyun B-PER
and o
declared o
his o
conversion o
to o
Buddhism o
, o
and o
since o
then o
he o
has o
never o
touched o
a o
drop o
of o
alcohol o
. o

" o
Before o
that o
, o
I o
always o
had o
a o
rhyming o
couplet o
pasted o
up o
by o
my o
doorway o
which o
read o
: o
' o
I o
know o
there o
is o
wine o
in o
this o
world o
, o
/ o
But o
not o
that o
it o
can o
make o
you o
drunk o
, o
' o
which o
was o
my o
way o
of o
bragging o
about o
my o
drinking o
prowess o
. o
" o

What o
power o
caused o
him o
to o
make o
such o
a o
great o
change o
? o

Chao B-PER
Ning I-PER
himself o
ca o
n't o
explain o
. o

" o
In o
the o
US B-GPE
, o
38 o
and o
49 o
are o
special o
ages o
. o

I o
had o
come o
to o
realize o
many o
things o
, o
and o
when o
fate o
brought o
the o
right o
opportunity o
, o
I o
was o
ready o
for o
a o
change o
of o
heart o
, o
" o
says o
Chao B-PER
. o

He o
converted o
to o
Buddhism o
at o
38 o
, o
got o
married o
at o
" o
491?2 o
, o
" o
and o
before o
many o
years o
had o
become o
the o
" o
super-old o
dad o
" o
of o
three o
children o
. o

The o
changes o
in o
Chao B-PER
Ning I-PER
's I-PER
life o
in o
middle o
age o
can o
not o
be o
described o
as o
small o
. o

" o
Looking o
back o
, o
it o
seems o
that o
none o
of o
the o
road o
I o
took o
in o
life o
is o
what o
I o
expected o
. o
" o

Chao B-PER
reveals o
that o
40 o
years o
ago o
when o
he o
was o
taking o
his o
college o
entrance o
exams o
, o
he o
put o
down o
all o
kinds o
of o
choices o
of o
university o
but o
deliberately o
did o
not o
include o
NTNU B-ORG
, o
because o
he o
thought o
he o
was o
not o
interested o
in o
being o
a o
teacher o
. o

But o
although o
he o
did o
not o
study o
at o
NTNU B-ORG
, o
he o
went o
to o
teach o
there o
, o
and o
has o
been o
there o
for o
over o
20 o
years o
. o

" o
Every o
year o
I o
make o
a o
big o
palaver o
about o
wanting o
to o
plan o
my o
life o
and o
how o
I o
'm o
going o
to o
give o
up o
teaching o
and o
concentrate o
on o
broadcasting o
. o
" o

Chao B-PER
continues o
with o
the o
same o
forthright o
, o
sincere o
smile o
: o

" o
But o
who o
'd o
have o
thought o
that o
in o
the o
blink o
of o
an o
eye o
my o
colleagues o
would o
be o
telling o
me o
: o
' o
Old o
Chao B-PER
, o
you o
need o
n't o
bother o
planning o
, o
you o
're o
soon o
going o
to o
retire o
! o
' o
" o

Although o
he o
never o
got o
around o
to o
planning o
his o
life o
, o
Chao B-PER
, o
who o
has o
always o
liked o
to o
" o
follow o
his o
feelings o
, o
" o
feels o
that o
every o
step o
he o
has o
taken o
has o
been o
steady o
and o
enriching o
. o

Now o
that o
he o
is o
about o
to o
leave o
middle o
age o
for o
the o
age o
of o
wisdom o
, o
this o
causes o
him o
to o
walk o
on o
eagerly o
, o
with o
a o
spring o
in o
his o
step o
. o

His o
only o
real o
worry o
is o
for o
his o
three o
children o
, o
now o
aged o
seven o
, o
five o
and o
two o
years o
old o
. o

Not o
daring o
to o
get o
old o

" o
Sometimes o
when o
I o
look o
at o
their o
lovely o
faces o
while o
they o
sleep o
, o
I o
feel o
I o
hav o
n't o
done o
right o
by o
them o
, o
because o
I o
'm o
so o
much o
older o
than o
they o
are o
. o
" o

The o
phrase o
most o
often o
on o
Chao B-PER
Ning I-PER
's I-PER
lips o
nowadays o
is o
, o
" o
Because o
my o
kids o
are o
small o
, o
I o
ca o
n't o
get o
old o
just o
yet o
. o
" o

Chao B-PER
plays o
basketball o
three o
times o
a o
week o
, o
and o
is o
early o
to o
bed o
and o
early o
to o
rise o
. o

Having o
become o
a o
father o
in o
middle o
age o
, o
he o
is o
doing o
his o
best o
to o
stay o
young o
for o
his o
children o
. o

Midlife o
changes o
may o
, o
as o
for o
Chao B-PER
Ning I-PER
, o
be o
one o
's o
own o
choices o
and o
bring o
satisfaction o
. o

But o
there o
are o
so o
many o
changes o
which o
are o
not o
chosen o
and o
are o
impossible o
to o
prevent o
, o
and o
of o
these o
unemployment o
is o
one o
of o
the o
most o
fearsome o
. o

The o
economic o
malaise o
which o
has o
spread o
through o
Taiwan B-GPE
in o
just o
the o
last o
two o
years o
is o
rapidly o
overtaking o
tens o
of o
thousands o
of o
middle o
- o
aged o
workers o
. o

" o
A o
few o
days o
ago o
I o
heard o
about o
the o
death o
of o
a o
friend o
of o
mine o
. o

After o
he o
was o
forced o
to o
retire o
from o
Taiwan B-ORG
Machinery I-ORG
Manufacturing I-ORG
Corporation I-ORG
, o
he o
set o
up o
a o
stand o
selling o
grilled o
food o
at o
Chichin B-LOC
bathing I-LOC
beach I-LOC
in o
Kaohsiung B-GPE
. o

But o
before o
long o
he o
died o
of o
a o
coronary o

Simon B-PER
Chang I-PER
, o
former o
managing o
director o
of o
the B-ORG
Chunghwa I-ORG
Telecom I-ORG
employees I-ORG
' I-ORG
union I-ORG
, o
says o
that o
on o
hearing o
the o
news o
, o
many o
of o
the o
deceased o
man o
's o
good o
friends o
could o
not o
help o
thinking o
: o
" o
If o
we o
'd o
known o
he o
'd o
die o
so o
young o
, o
we o
should o
n't o
have o
stopped o
him o
that o
time o
when o
he o
wanted o
to o
go o
after o
the o
boss o
of o
TMMC B-ORG
with o
a o
Molotov o
cocktail o
! o
" o

Chang B-PER
, o
who o
worked o
at o
CHT B-ORG
for o
over o
10 o
years o
, o
says o
that o
next o
year o
the o
company o
plans o
to o
cut o
its o
workforce o
by o
a o
full o
3,000 o
people o
, o
which o
means o
that o
within o
the o
next o
year o
3,000 o
people o
will o
be o
" o
forced o
to o
retire o
. o
" o

But o
the o
average o
age o
of o
CHT B-ORG
's o
workers o
is o
only o
46 o

! o

Who o
will o
tell o
me o
? o
! o

Forty o
- o
six o
- o
what o
an o
awkward o
age o
. o

The o
majority o
of o
these o
workers o
are o
carrying o
the o
tremendous o
burden o
of o
being o
the o
breadwinner o
for o
three o
generations o
. o

" o
The o
sense o
of o
uncertainty o
about o
employment o
has o
begun o
to o
affect o
every o
facet o
of o
life o
. o
" o

Simon B-PER
Chang I-PER
says o
that o
this o
is o
a o
cause o
of o
marital o
tension o
, o
and o
these o
workers o
have o
thousands o
of o
questions o
sticking o
in o
their o
throats o
, o
such o
as o
: o
Will o
they o
have o
to o
interrupt o
their o
children o
's o
education o
? o

Should o
they o
accept o
a o
transfer o
, o
and o
move o
the o
whole o
family o
somewhere o
else o
? o

What o
kind o
of o
second o
skill o
should o
they o
learn o
to o
keep o
themselves o
employable o
? o

How o
long o
a o
buffer o
period o
can o
the o
company o
give o
them o
? o

But o
nobody o
is o
willing o
to o
give o
them o
a o
clear o
answer o
. o

Chang B-PER
suggests o
that o
rather o
than o
the o
government o
spending o
vast o
amounts o
on o
unemployment o
benefits o
, o
it o
would o
be o
better o
for o
it o
to o
set o
up o
a o
life o
guidance o
and o
psychological o
counseling o
system o
for o
workers o
at o
all o
state o
- o
owned o
and o
private o
enterprises o
, o
as o
quickly o
as o
possible o
. o

" o
What o
we o
want o
is o
n't o
money o
, o
but o
clear o
guidance o
to o
the o
future o
! o
" o

" o
For o
a o
middle o
- o
aged o
person o
, o
losing o
one o
's o
job o
is o
just o
as o
traumatic o
as o
a o
car o
accident o
, o
falling o
ill o
, o
the o
death o
of o
a o
spouse o
or o
a o
child o
running o
away o
from o
home o
. o

It o
's o
an o
event o
beyond o
their o
control o
which o
suddenly o
turns o
their o
life o
upside o
- o
down o

, o
describes o
this o
kind o
of o
occurrence o
as o
a o
" o
non-normative o
event o

" o

Such o
events o
are o
much o
more o
traumatic o
than o
" o
normative o
events o
" o
such o
as o
job o
stress o
, o
a o

growing o
up o

leaving o

, o
or o
being o
passed o
over o
for o
promotion o
, o
all o
of o
which o
are o
more o
predictable o
. o

Looking o
around o
us o
, o
there o
are o
many o
middle o
- o
aged o
people o
who o
, o
although o
one o
can o
not o
say o
they o
are o

do o

a o

his o
youth o
, o
Lin B-PER
Hung I-PER

kui I-PER
of o
Chungli B-GPE
in o
Taoyuan B-GPE
County I-GPE
started o
up o
in o
business o
from o
nothing o
, o
selling o
shaved o
iced o
snacks o
. o

He o
did o
well o
, o
and o
used o
his o
money o
to o
buy o
three o
or o
four o
shops o
and o
apartments o
. o

In o
the o
end o
he o
gave o
up o
his o
shop o
because o
the o
work o
became o
physically o
too o
demanding o
, o
but o
after o
several o
failed o
attempts o
in o
other o
lines o
of o
business o
, o
today o
he o
can o
only o
live o
on o
his o
savings o
and o
the o
rent o
from o
his o
apartments o
. o

He o
has o
enough o
to o
get o
by o
, o
but o
spending o
the o
whole o
day o
doing o
nothing o
he o
finds o
it o
difficult o
to o
face o
the o
inquiring o
glances o
of o
neighbors o
. o

Two o
years o
ago o
, o
encouraged o
by o
his o
wife o
, o
who o
works o
for o
an o
estate o
agency o
, o
Lin B-PER
went o
on o
a o
pre-work o
training o
course o
at o
the o
agency o

Being o
stuck o
in o
among o
a o
group o
of o
young o
kids o
in o
their o
twenties o
, o
and o
being o
subjected o
to o
" o
shock o
style o
" o
training o
- o
including o
listening o
to o
pep o
talks o
, o
singing o
military o
songs o
and o
shouting o
slogans o
at o
the o
tops o
of o
their o
voices o
- o
made o
Lin B-PER
feel o
very o
uncomfortable o
. o

Finally o
, o
after o
sticking o
it o
out o
for o
a o
month o
, o
he o
quit o
the o
job o
on o
receiving o
his o
first o
pay o
packet o

" o
There o
are o
many o
things o
which o
young o
people o
can o
do o
without o
any o
inhibitions o
, o
but o
in o
middle o
age o
you o
build o
yourself o
all o
kinds o
of o
high o
walls o
which o
are o
very o
hard o

himself o
lucky o

for o
he o
does o
n't o
need o
to o
break o
his o
back o
just o
to o
earn o
a o
pittance o

But o
his o
mood o
is o
always o
uncertain o

the o

two o

he o
has o

the o

in o
the o

background o
, o
she o
always o
worked o
hard o
to o
hold o
down o
these o
three o
jobs o
. o

But o
the o
more o
she o
saw o
of o
life o
, o
the o
more o
dissatisfied o
she o
felt o
with o
her o
own o
situation o
, o
and o
hoped o
she o
could o
make o
a o
new o
breakthrough o
. o

Although o
she o
had o
been o
cautious o
all o
her o
life o
, o
at o
the o
age o
of o
42 o
she o
quit o
her o
jobs o
, o
and o
with o
a o
sense o
of o
release o
tinged o
with o
trepidation o
, o
went o
to o
study o
overseas o
. o

After o
leaving o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
Chiu B-PER
found o
a o
school o
in o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
where o
most o
of o
the o
students o
were o
about o
her o
age o
. o

Like o
her o
, o
many o
had o
come o
there o
because o
they o
had o
arrived o
at o
a o
point o
where o
they o
did o
not o
know o
what o
to o
do o
with o
their o
lives o
. o

They o
had o
not o
come o
to o
earn o
a o
degree o
, o
but o
simply o
, o
through o
the o
process o
of o
study o
, o
to o
" o
sort o
out o
their o
lives o
bit o
by o
bit o
. o
" o

After o
five o
years o
in o
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, o
Chiu B-PER
felt o
she o
had o
developed o
a o
great o
deal o
, o
and o
had o
enough o
strength o
to o
help o
people o
who o
needed o
help o
. o

So o
she o
returned o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
become o
a o
full o
- o
time o
counselor o
. o

" o
When o
I o
felt o
that o
I o
had o
reached o
a o
crisis o
, o
I o
did o
n't o
run o
away o
from o
it o
, o
but o
made o
the o
crisis o
into o
a o
challenge o
and o
faced o
it o
with o
courage o
. o
" o

Looking o
back o
on o
this o
phase o
of o
her o
life o
, o
Chiu B-PER
can o
not o
suppress o
a o
smile o
. o

" o
I o
would o
n't o
call o
it o
success o
, o
and o
it o
does o
n't o
mean o
I o
do o
n't o
have o
any o
struggles o
left o
in o
my o
life o
. o

But o
I o
know o
I o
've o
had o
at o

one o
experience o
of o
winning o
a o
battle o
with o
myself o

that o
false o

often o

where o

large o
areas o
of o

from o

As o

pushed o
Taiwan B-GPE
continuously o
upwards o
and o
the o

downward o
, o
such o
areas o
of o

occurred o
in o
many o

Doughty o
false o

seeds o
seized o
the o
opportunity o
to o

this o

shunned o
by o

. o

There o
they o
gradually o
grew o
into o
gigantic o
trees o
, o
rehabilitating o
the o
land o
and o
attracting o
other o
species o
. o

At o
the o

time o
they o
protected o
downstream o
areas o
, o
making o
them o
suitable o
for o

and o

of o

have o
carried o
their o

mountain o

, o
to o
slowly o
condense o
onto o
the o
slopes o
where o
the o

Steeped o

the o

19th o
century o
human o
beings o
swarmed o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
dark o
mountains o
like o
busy o
worker o
ants o
. o

The o
false o
cypresses o
, o
which o
had o
conversed o
with o
the o
clouds o
for o
a o
million o
years o
, o
were o
identified o
as o
top o
- o
grade o
timber o
, o
and o
were o
thus o
condemned o
to o
an o
inexorable o
fate o
. o

After o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
ceded o
to o
Japan B-GPE
following o
the o
Sino o
- o
Japanese o
war o
of o
1894 o
, o
while o
the o
Japanese o
were o
still o
quelling o
resistance o
to o
their o
rule o
they o
also o
went o
into o
the o
island o
's o
mountains o
to o
collect o
botanical o
specimens o
. o

In o
1896 o
, o
a o
Japanese o
biologist o
collected o
the o
first o
specimen o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
cypress o
on o
Yushan B-GPE
, o
and o
before o
long o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
was o
found o
there o
too o
. o

In o
1899 o
, o
the o
great o
cypress o
forests o
of o
Mt. B-LOC
Ali I-LOC
were o
discovered o
, o
and o
in o
1912 o
, o
the o
Japanese o
colonial o
government o
began o
large o
- o
scale o
logging o
there o
. o

Everywhere o
the o
Alishan o
Mountain o
Railway o
passes o
at o
higher o
elevations o
was o
once o
cypress o
forest o
. o

Soon o
afterwards o
the o
forests o
of o
Mt. B-LOC
Taiping I-LOC
in o
modern o
Ilan B-GPE
County I-GPE
and o
Mt. B-LOC
Pahsien I-LOC
in o
Nantou B-GPE
were o
also o
opened o
up o
for o
logging o
. o

Endless o
streams o
of o
cypress o
logs o
flowed o
out o
of o
the o
mountains o
, o
and o
were o
carried o
across o
the o
sea o
to o
Japan B-GPE
to o
become o
pillars o
for o
Shinto o
shrines o
. o

Quite o
apart o
from o
the o
incomparable o
quality o
of o
their o
timber o
, o
in o
terms o
of o
numbers o
alone o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
and o
yellow o
cypress o
took o
second o
and o
third o
place o
among o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
trees o
, o
so o
they o
became o
long o
- o
term o
cash o
cows o
for o
the o
island o
's o
forestry o
industry o
. o

After o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
return o
to o
Chinese o
rule o
, o
from o
the o
1950s o
to o
the o
1980s o
the o
ROC B-GPE
used o
forestry o
income o
to o
support o
its o
industrial o
development o
. o

The o
logging o
grounds o
advanced o
deep o
into o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
heart o
, o
consuming o
even o
greater o
areas o
than o
under o
the o
Japanese o
. o

False o
cypresses o
accounted o
for o
two o
- o
thirds o
of o
the o
300,000 o
hectares o
of o
commercial o
forest o
, o
and o
contributed o
70 o
- o
80 o
% o
of o
forestry o
income o
. o

All o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
forest o
recreation o
areas o
today o
are o
to o
be o
found o
in o
the o
former o
cypress o
logging o
grounds o
. o

The o
Alishan o
Mountain o
Railway o
, o
and o
the o
long o
forestry o
roads o
which o
wind o
through o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
four o
major o
mountain o
ranges o
, o
were o
all o
built o
for o
the o
sole o
purpose o
of o
shifting o
the o
huge o
cypress o
logs o
down o
the o
slopes o

" o
You o
could o
say o
that o
everything o
connected o
with o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
forestry o
industry o
developed o
around o
the o
false o
cypresses o
, o

The o
history o
of o
forestry o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
a o
history o
of o
false o
cypress o
felling o
, o
says o
Yang B-PER
. o

Hinoki o
and o
merihi o

If o
you o
speak o
of o
" o
hinoki o
, o
" o
the o
Japanese o
name o
of o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
, o
older o
Taiwanese o
will o
lift o
their o
noses o
as o
if o
catching o
a o
whiff o
of o
its o
unmistakable o
fragrance o
- o
it o
has o
a o
firm o
place o
in o
their o
memories o
as o
the o
best o
of o
timbers o
. o

The o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
and o
red o
cypress o
each o
have o
their o
own o
different o
qualities o
. o

The o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
grows o
pencil o
- o
straight o
towards o
the o
heavens o
, o
and o
has o
a o
higher o
content o
of o
oil o
, o
from o
which o
a o
fragrant o
essence o
can o
be o
refined o
. o

In o
1971 o
, o
after o
the o
Shinto o
gate o
at o
the o
Meiji o
Shrine o
in o
Tokyo B-GPE
was o
struck o
by o
lightning o
, o
the o
Japanese o
authorities o
especially o
came o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
buy o
11 o
huge o
, o
straight o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
logs o
16 o
to o
24 o
meters o
long o
, o
cut o
from o
trees o
over o
1,500 o
years o
old o
, o
to o
create o
the o
world o
's o
biggest o
Shinto o
gate o
. o

As o
for o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
cypress o
- o
merihi o
in o
Japanese o
- o
it o
is o
even o
more o
magnificent o
in o
appearance o
than o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
. o

But o
the o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
cypress o
's o
trunk o
is o
often o
divided o
, o
and o
because o
it o
mostly o
grows o
in o
wet o
river o
valleys o
the o
heartwood o
is o
prone o
to o
be o
eaten o
away o
by o
bacteria o
, o
producing o
strangely o
tangled o
hollow o
trees o
. o

The o
crown o
is o
also o
broad o
and o
difficult o
to o
cut o
. o

This o
is o
why o
the o
gigantic o
ancient o
trees o
that o
have o
escaped o
the o
loggers o
' o
chainsaws o
, o
such o
as o
those o
at o
Mt. B-LOC
Ali I-LOC
and o
Mt. B-LOC
Lala I-LOC
, o
are o
all o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
cypress o
. o

Human o
life o
is o
fleeting o
, o
but o
cypress o
is o
forever o
. o

As o
the o
forestry o
industry o
gradually o
declined o
, o
the o
forestry o
huts o
built o
in o
the B-LOC
Central I-LOC
Range I-LOC
in o
the o
Japanese o
period o
fell o
into o
disrepair o
, o
but o
their o
cypress o
- o
wood o
washbasins o
are o
still o
as o
good o
as o
new o
. o

The o
close o
grain o
of o
their o
growth o
rings o
reveals o
their o
age o
, o
and o
their o
resilience o
. o

In o
the o
early o
days o
, o
the o
sleepers o
used o
for o
the o
Alishan o
Mountain o
Railway o
were o
cut o
from o
broadleaved o
trees o
such o
as o
beech o
and o
Michelia o
compressa o
. o

But o
tough o
as o
these o
woods o
are o
, o
the o
sleepers o
only o
stood o
up o
to o
three o
to o
five o
years o
of o
logging o
trains o
rumbling o
over o
them o
, o
so o
there o
was o
no o
choice o
but o
to o
change o
them o
all o
for o
sleepers o
made o
of o
false o
cypress o
wood o
, o
which o
lasted o
for o
decades o
. o

And o
when o
the o
railways o
were o
finally o
taken o
out o
of o
service o
, o
the B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
Forestry I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
-LRB- I-ORG

-RRB- I-ORG
sold o
off o
the o
old o
sleepers o
, o
and o
from o
the o
proceeds o
not o
only o
was o
able o
to o
recoup o
the o
cost o
of o
dismantling o
the o
railways o
, o
but o
was o
also o
left o
with o
a o
tidy o
sum o
for o
its o
own o
coffers o
. o

For o
the o
older o
generation o
, o
the o
excellence o
of o
false o
cypress o
wood o
is o
hard o
to o
put o
into o
words o
. o

Old o
folk o
to o
this o
day o
still o
rattle o
on o
about o
how o
the o
cypress o
- o
wood o
sleeping o
platforms o
of o
Japanese o
- o
style o
houses o
were o
long o
- o
lasting o
and o
hard o
- o
wearing o
, o
and o
how o
the o
best o
bathtubs o
were o
of o
course o
those o
of o
made o
of o
false o
cypress o
wood o
. o

In o
the o
eyes o
of o
furniture o
makers o
, o
" o
False o
cypress o
wood o
is o
light o
and o
easy o
to o
work o
; o
it o
is o
flexible o
, o
rotproof o
and o
termite o
resistant o
. o

It o
rarely o
warps o
, o
and o
hardly o
shrinks o
; o
it o
planes o
to o
a o
smooth o
, o
fine o
surface o
. o

It o
's o
so o
versatile o
: o
boats o
, o
bridges o
, o
carriages o
, o
cabinets o
or o
coffins o
- o
there o
's o
not o
one o
it o
's o
not o
suitable o
for o
. o
" o

In o
short o
, o
of o
all o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
commercial o
timbers o
, o
there o
's o
not o
another o
to o
match o
it o
. o

Pining o
away o

However o
, o
behind o
these o
sweet o
memories o
of o
cypress o
wood o
are o
the o
regrets o
of o
the o
foresters o
. o

Surveys o
made o
before o
logging o
began o
at o
Mt. B-LOC
Ali I-LOC
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
earliest o
cypress o
logging o
area o
, o
showed o
that o
there o
were o
more o
than o
300,000 o
false o
cypresses o
over o
1,000 o
years o
old o
, o
but o
today o
all o
that o
remains o
of o
them o
is o
a o
few o
lonely o
- o
looking o
old o
trees o
scattered o
among o
introduced o
Japanese o
red o
cedar o
-LRB- o
Cryptomeria o
japonica o
-RRB- o
and o
flowering o
cherries o
. o

Despite o
its o
great o
fame o
, o
deprived o
of o
the o
company o
of o
its o
own o
species o
the o
most o
celebrated o
of o
the o
giant o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o
cypresses o
of o
Mt. B-LOC
Ali I-LOC
finally o
succumbed o
to o
lightning o
and o
fire o
. o

The o
TFB B-ORG
once o
hoped o
that o
if o
a o
few o
false o
cypresses o
were o
left o
standing o
in o
each o
of o
the o
old o
logging o
areas o
, o
they o
would o
seed o
naturally o
. o

But o
they o
discovered o
that o
although o
the o
trees o
were o
completely o
uninjured o
, o
they o
died o
one o
by o
one o
. o

Late o
Taiwanese o
forestry o
expert o
Liu B-PER
Chin I-PER
described o
these o
few o
remaining o
trees o
as o
" o
dying o
of o
loneliness o
. o
" o

It o
seems o
that o
when o
abandoned o
by o
the o
companions o
they o
had o
relied o
on o
for o
millennia o
, o
and o
left o
to o
face o
the o
rigors o
of o
their o
environment o
alone o
, o
these o
ancient o
survivors o
went o
into o
terminal o
decline o
. o

But o
an o
even o
greater o
cause o
for o
regret o
is o
that o
" o
50 o
years o
of o
intensive o
false o
cypress o
logging o
tore o
the o
heart o
out o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
life o
- o
support o
system o
. o

This o
devastation o
, o
coupled o
with o
agriculture o
moving o
up o
into o
the o
mountains o
, o
can o
only o
result o
in o
landslides o
, o
floods o
and o
all o
kinds o
of o
' o
natural o
' o
disasters o
. o
. o
. o
. o
" o

With o
ecologists o
' o
warnings o
ringing o
in o
their o
ears o
, o
now o
that o
floods o
and o
mudslides o
have o
become o
a o
common o
occurrence o
, o
people o
can o
only o
nod o
in o
tacit o
agreement o
. o

Large o
- o
scale o
logging o
of o
false o
cypresses o
continued o
right o
up o
to o
1989 o
. o

With o
forestry o
earning o
no o
profits o
, o
and o
in o
response o
to o
energetic o
lobbying o
by o
civic o
groups o
, o
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
finally o
banned o
the o
cutting o
of o
natural o
forests o
, o
at o
last o
giving o
a o
respite o
to o
the o
giant o
trees o
which o
protect o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
land o
. o

But o
the o
great o
wall o
of o
20 o
million o
gigantic o
false o
cypress o
trees o
which o
once o
stretched o
the o
length o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
had o
already o
been o
breached o
. o

Apart o
from o

Humans o
cut o
down o
the o
million o
year o

in o
less o
than o
a o
century o
, o
but o
the o
story o
of o
their o
destruction o
is o
not o
over o
. o

Amazingly o
, o
the o
ban o
on o
logging o
natural o
forests o
has o
not o
protected o
Chilan B-LOC
, o
the o
only o
single o

species o

of o

surviving o
in o

almost o
6,000 o

To o

, o
VACRS B-ORG
has o
continued o
logging o
there o
under o
the o
pretext o
of o
" o
clearing o
away o
dead o
and o
fallen o
trees o
to o
make o
space o
for o
young o
trees o
to o
grow o
. o
" o

Ecologists o
and o
biologists o
can o
only o
repeat o
again o
: o

" o
The o
trees o
have o
been o
growing o
by o
themselves o
for o
tens o
of o
thousands o
of o
years o
, o
so o
why o
would o
they o
need o
human o
help o
for o
their o
saplings o
to o
grow o
? o
" o

In o
response o
to o
this o
situation o
a o
popular o
movement o
sprang o
up o
to o
push o
for o
the o
establishment o
of o
a o
" o
cypress o
forest o
national o
park o
, o
" o
in o
the o
hope o
that o
with o
national o
park o
status o
, o
the o
last o
remaining o
virgin o
Taiwan B-GPE
yellow o
cypress o
forest o
could o
be o
saved o
. o

Perhaps o
the o
millennium o
year o
was o
a o
decisive o
one o
for o
the o
trees o
, o
for o
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
allocated o
new o
funds o
to o
the o
VACRS B-ORG
so o
that o
it o
no o
longer o
needs o
to o
cut o
down o
trees o
to o
bolster o
its o
finances o
, o
and o
also o
approved o
a o
plan o
to o
set o
up o
a o
national o
park o
. o

But o
so o
- o
called o
ecotourism o
is o
now o
emerging o
as o
another o
threat o
to o
the o
trees o
' o
survival o
. o

To o
assure o
the o
livelihood o
of o
the o
local o
Atayal o
aborigines o
of o
Chilan B-LOC
, o
when o
the o
cypress o
national o
park o
is o
set o
up o
consideration o
will o
have o
to o
be o
given o
to o
how o
to o
balance o
the o
need o
to o
protect o
the o
forests o
with o
the o
demand o
for o
sustainable o
tourism o
. o

How o
can o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
false o
cypresses o
become o
more o
than o
just o
a o
tool o
of o
human o
economic o
activity o
? o

Can o
the o
sad o
history o
of o
cypress o
logging o
teach o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
a o
lesson o
in o
how o
to o
truly o
care o
for o
their o
land o
? o

Perhaps o
these o
questions o
are o
still o
more o
important o
than o
the o
issue o
of o
establishing o
a o
national o
park o
. o

A o
future o
for o
the o
cypresses o
? o

At o
the o
Atayal o
village o
of o
Chenhsipao B-GPE
in o
Hsinchu B-GPE
County I-GPE
, o
by o
three o
in o
the o
afternoon o
the o
clouds o
rolling o
in o
from o
afar o
have o
quietly o
slipped o
over o
the o
ridges o
and o
covered o
the o
whole o
mountainside o
where o
the o
cypress o
trees o
grow o
. o

Here o
, o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
remote o
but o
vitally o
important o
heartland o
, o
gigantic o
trees o
which o
have o
survived o
the o
long o
river o
of o
time o
and o
escaped o
the o
ravages o
of o
logging o
stand o
undaunted o
, o
like o
guardian o
spirits o
quietly o
protecting o
the o
Atayal o
people o
and o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
land o
. o

Only o
if o
we o
can o
allow o
the o
cypress o
trees o
a o
future o
, o
will o
the o
people o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
also o
have o
a o
lasting o
future o

Mt. B-LOC

in o

But o
the o

commercial o
size o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
red o

is o
150 o

And o
at o
this o

In o
the o
past o
, o
Gao B-PER
's o
works o
of o
fiction o
have o
not o
sold o
particularly o
well o
, o
perhaps o
because o
some o
find o
them o
to o
be o
cold o
or o
to o
resemble o
to o
long o
, o
mumbling o
soliloquies o

At o
this o
year o
's o
TIBE o
, o
however o
, o
the o
glow o
of o
Gao B-PER
's o
Nobel o

sparked o
interest o
in o
his o
work o
. o

Over o
the o
exhibition o

six o

purchased o
between o
five o

Whether o
Taiwanese o
readers o
were o
just o
putting o
on o
airs o
or o
actually o
enjoyed o
the o
book o
, o
if o
the o
Gao B-PER
frenzy o
reinvigorates o
Taiwanese o
interest o
in o
pure o
literature o
, o
it o
will o
have o
done o
a o
world o
of o
good o
. o

Gao B-PER
's o
own o
artistic o
life o
extends o
beyond o
fiction o
to o
painting o
and o
theater o
. o

Over o
the o
past o
few o
years o
he o
has o
held o
two o

of o

In o

, o

special o

of o

The o

was o
given o
at o
the o
Novel o
Hall o
in o
Taipei B-GPE
, o
during o
this o
visit o
of o

. o

And o
Gao B-PER
himself o

August o

The o
refined o
language o
of o
literature o

Having o
a o
chance o
to o
see o
Gao B-PER
in o
person o
, o
TIBE o
visitors o
naturally o
focused o
on o
his o
artistic o
vision o
and o
creative o
process o
. o

In o
a o
speech o
presented o
at o
the o
exhibition o
, o
Gao B-PER
stated o
that o
over o
the o
course o
of o
decades o
of o
writing o
, o
he o
has o
given o
ever o
- o
greater o
attention o
to o
the o
heart o
of o
literature o
- o
the o
art o
of o
language o
. o

To o
Gao B-PER
, o
the o
only o
standard o
for o
judging o
literature o
is o
the o
beauty o
of o
its o
language o
, o
and o
language o
itself o
is o
a o
means o
of o
getting o
at o
" o
reality o
. o
" o

Gao B-PER
refers o
to o
his o
own o
approach o
to o
writing o
as o
" o
stream o
- o
of o
- o
language o
" o
and o
believes o
that o
writers o
who o
seek o
a o
vivid o
, o
modern o
Chinese o
face o
an o
extremely o
difficult o
path o
. o

Gao B-PER
also o
revealed o
that o
to o
ensure o
that o
his o
own o
writing o
remains o
fresh o
and o
lively o
, o
he o
first o
speaks o
his o
thoughts o
into o
a o
recorder o
before o
later o
recasting o
them o
in o
a o
written o
form o
. o

Gao B-PER
Xingjian I-PER
feels o
that o
writing o
is o
an o
extremely o
personal o
pursuit o
, o
that o
its o
starting o
point o
is o
a o
quest o
for o
personal o
values o
. o

If o
a o
writer o
is o
to o
produce o
good o
work o
, o
he o
must o
cast o
aside o
political o
and o
social o
missions o
, o
disregard o
the o
opinions o
of o
readers o
and o
the o
market o
, o
and o
instead o
must o
write o
spontaneously o
, o
listening o
carefully o
to o
the o
faintest o
, o
most o
honest o
voice o
in o
his o
heart o
. o

Considering o
that o
Gao B-PER
fled o
a o
tyrannical o
government o
to o
become o
an o
expatriate o
, o
many o
people o
wonder o
whether o
Gao B-PER
's o
literature o
insists o
upon o
humanitarianism o
and o
high o
principles o
. o

But o
Gao B-PER
feels o
that o
literature o
is o
above o
politics o
and o
should o
not o
serve o
it o
. o

Further o
, o
literature o
should o
not o
be o
limited o
by o
morals o
, o
ethics o
or o
public o
sentiment o
. o

In o
Gao B-PER
's o
view o
, o
20th o
century o
literature o
too o
often o
emphasized o
" o
literary o
revolution o
" o
or o
was o
" o
revolutionary o
literature o
. o
" o

It o
was o
too o
often o
tied o
to o
a o
preposterous o
sense o
of o
mission o
which o
took o
literature o
with o
it o
to o
the o
grave o
. o

As o
Gao B-PER
said o
at o
the o
Nobel o
Prize o
awards o
ceremony o
, o
Communist o
rule o
stymied o
the o
development o
of o
mainland o
Chinese o
literature o
. o

Not o
surprisingly o
, o
the o
Chinese o
Communists o
were o
critical o
of o
the o
selection o
of o
Gao B-PER
as o
a o
Nobel o
Laureate o
, o
labeling o
his o
choice o
an o
" o
imperialist o
conspiracy o
" o
and o
another o
" o
insult o
to o
all o
Chinese o
" o
by o
the o
West B-LOC
. o

This o
standoff o
between o
the o
Nobel o
laureate o
and o
his o
cultural o
motherland o
adds o
a o
note o
of o
regret o
to o
the o
joy o
of o
Chinese o
people o
around o
the o
world o
. o

Soul o
Mountain o
and o
the o
flesh o

Given o
that o
Gao B-PER
wrote o
his o
works o
in o
Chinese o
, o
his o
translator o
played o
a o
major o
role o
in o
his o
winning o
of o
the o
Nobel o
prize o
. o

and o
other o
works o
by o
Gao B-PER
, o
also o
attended o
this o
year o
's o
TIBE o
. o

To o
reflect o
the o
growing o
internationalization o
of o
Chinese o
literature o
, o
this o
year o
's o
TIBE o
even o
included o
a o
Taiwanese o
Literature o
in o
Translation o
pavilion o
. o

The o
pavilion o
hosted o
a o
number o
of o
seminars o
and o
colloquia o
on o
literary o
translation o
, o
providing o
readers o
with o
some o
insight o
into o
a o
field o
with o
which o
most o
are o
unfamiliar o
. o

Gao B-PER
has o
touched o
off o
another o
interesting o
debate o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
- o
one o
on o
the o
competing o
desires o
of o
the o
spirit o
and o
the o
flesh o
. o

Discussing o
Gao B-PER
together o
with o
former o
Japanese o
porn o
star o
Iijima B-PER
Ai I-PER
causes o
many o
cultural o
critics o
to o
shake o
their o
heads o
, o
but o
the o
two o
writers o
' o
works o
are o
not o
that o
dissimilar o
. o

While o
Soul o
Mountain o
describes o
one o
man o
's o
spiritual o
journey o
, o
it o
also o
contains o
numerous o
graphic o
descriptions o
of o
sexual o
desire o
. o

Similarly o
, o
Ai B-PER
's o
book o
on o
the o
flesh o
actually o
expresses o
her o
longing o
for o
spiritual o
love o
. o

These o
two o
works o
remind o
us o
that o
the o
spirit o
and o
the o
flesh o
are o
both o
aspects o
of o
being o
human o
and o
that o
the o
distance o
between o
these o
two o
" o
opposing o
desires o
" o
is o
not o
as o
great o
as o
most o
people o
seem o
to o
think o
. o

While o
Gao B-PER
Xingjian I-PER
is o
the o
first o
Nobel o
Laureate o
in o
literature o
to o
have o
attended o
the o
TIBE o

The o

stated o
that o
it o

the o

of o

would o
give o

Preliminary o
containment o
of o
the o
resulting o
oil o
spill o
was o
not o
achieved o
until o
late o
February o
. o

In o
the o
meantime o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
has o
been o
hit o
by o
a o
rash o
of o
forest o
fires o
. o

Clearly o
, o
the o
activities o
of o
man o
are o
becoming o
increasingly o
destructive o
of o
nature o
. o

Can o
we o
expect o
to o
go o
on o
forever o
wreaking o
havoc o
on o
the o
earth o
without o
inviting o
a o
backlash o
from o
Mother o
Nature o
? o

The o
armed o
forces o
dispatched o
thousands o
of o
soldiers o
to o
deal o
with o
the o
oil o
spill o
at o
Lungkeng B-GPE
, o
located o
at o
the o
southern o
tip o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
the o
first o
phase o
of o
the o
cleanup o
was o
completed o
on o
February o
16 o
with o
the o
removal o
of o
over o
300 o
tons o
of o
oil o
from o
the o
shore o
. o

The o
second o
phase o
entails o
cleaning o
the o
uplifted o
coral o
seashore o
and o
restoring o
the o
environment o
of o
the o
intertidal o
zone o
. o

The o
problem o
is o
that o
efforts o
to o
clean o
up o
the o
oil o
could o
cause o
great o
damage o
to o
the o
complex o
ecology o
of o
the o
coral o
shoreline o
and o
destroy o
the o
beauty o
of o
the o

zone o
. o

How o
to o
go o
about o
undoing o
the o
environmental o
destruction o
that o
has o
already o
occurred o
? o

Due o
to o
a o
lack o
of o
comprehensive o
studies o
, o
the o
local o
environment o
in o
Lungkeng B-GPE
is o
not o
sufficiently o
understood o
. o

With o
scholars o
still o
in o
the o
midst o
of o
research o
, o
it o
has o
been o
impossible o
to o
take o
concrete o
action o
. o

The o
oil o
spill o
occurred o
at o
about o
5 o
p.m. o
on o
January o
14 o
when o
the o
Greek o
freighter o
MV o
Amorgos o
carrying o
ore o
from o
India B-GPE
to o
the o
port o
of o
Nantong B-GPE
in o
mainland o
China B-GPE
ran o
aground o
about o
a o
kilometer o
off o
the o
cape o
at o
Oluanpi B-GPE
. o

A o
thousand o
tons o
of o
fuel o
oil o
began o
pouring o
through o
the o
ship o
's o
torn o
hull o
. o

The o
disaster o
has o
hit o
the o
uplifted o
coral o
at o
Lungkeng B-GPE
the o
hardest o
. o

The o
ocean o
waves o
brought o
the o
oil o
to o
shore o
, o
making o
a o
mess o
of o
the o
beautiful o
coral o
coastline o
, o
slathering o
shellfish o
and o
aquatic o
plants o
, o
and o
filling o
the o
air o
with o
a o
petroleum o
stench o
. o

Taiwanese o
society o
, o
caught o
up o
in o
the o
furor o
over o
the o
nuclear o
power o
plant o
up o
north o
, o
took o
little o
immediate o
notice o
of o
the o
accident o
. o

The o
shipowner o
did o
n't o
stop o
up o
the o
leaking o
hull o
of o
the o
MV o
Amorgos o
until o
the o
end o
of o
January o
. o

He o
went o
through o
a o
shipping o
agent o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
hire o
local o
residents o
in o
Lungkeng B-GPE
to o
clean o
up o
the o
shoreline o
, o
but o
the o
oil o
slick o
had o
mucked o
up o
a o
three o
- o
kilometer o
stretch o
of o
strikingly o
beautiful o
blue o
waters o
, o
throwing o
a o
pall o
over o
the o
local o
tourism o
and o
fishing o
industries o
. o

After o
days o
of o
bitter o
complaints o
, o
aggrieved o
residents o
finally o
got o
the o
attention o
of o
the o
news o
media o
. o

On o
February o
7 o
, o
three o
weeks o
after o
the o
spill o
, o
the B-ORG
Environmental I-ORG

Administration I-ORG
formed o
an o
emergency o
task o
force o
, o
and o
EPA B-ORG

Edgar B-PER
Lin I-PER
headed o
south o
to o
inspect o
the o
site o
. o

On o
February o

, o
Premier o
Chang B-PER
Chun I-PER
- I-PER
hsiung I-PER
and o
several o
other o
high o

boarded o
a o
military o
helicopter o
for o
an o
aerial o
survey o
of o
the o

, o
and o
the o

and o
the B-ORG

to o
get o
the o
oil o
cleaned o
up o
within o
30 o
working o
days o
. o

The o
EPA B-ORG
worked o
up o
an o
estimate o
of o
the o
cost o
of o
cleanup o
, o
ship o
removal o
, o
and o
reparations o
to o
fishermen o
, o
and o
notified o
both o
the o
shipowner o
and o
the o
insurance o
company o
. o

The o
ship o

captain o
and o
other o
ship o
officers o
had o
to o
post o
bond o
before o
they o
were o
allowed o
to o
leave o
Taiwan B-GPE
. o

In o
addition o
to o
these o
emergency o
measures o
, o
the o
EPA B-ORG
has o
also o
been o
working o
to o
draft o
: o
-LRB- o
1 o
-RRB- o
a o
set o
of o
guidelines o
for o
establishing o
task o
forces o
to o
deal o
with o
major o
maritime o
environmental o
disasters o
; o
and o
-LRB- o
2 o
-RRB- o
an o
emergency o
response o
plan o
for o
maritime o
oil o
spills o
. o

Draft o
versions o
of o
both o
these o
documents o
will o
be o
presented o
to o
the o
cabinet o
as o
soon o
as o
possible o
. o

The o
cabinet o
will o
request o
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
to o
authorize o
an o
extraordinary o
budget o
allocation o
to o
cover o
the o
purchase o
of o
oil o
containment o
booms o
, o
sorbents o
, o
helicopters o
, o
and o
other o
equipment o
needed o
for o
responding o
to o
oil o
spills o
. o

The o
problem o
, o
however o
, o
is o
that o
authorities o
did o
not o
respond o
in o
the o
critical o
first o
few o
hours o
and o
days o
following o
the o
spill o
. o

This o
failure o
focused o
renewed o
attention o
on o
poor o
coordination o
between o
the o
central o
and o
local o
governments o
. o

In o
a o
public o
opinion o
poll o
, o
nearly o
70 o
% o
of o
respondents o
indicated o
dissatisfaction o
with o
the o
government o
's o
handling o
of o
the o
oil o
spill o
. o

With o
today o
's o
huge o
volume o
of o
international o
shipping o
, o
oil o
spills o
are o
becoming o
a o
serious o
problem o
. o

Although o
the o
recent o
spill o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
was o
small o
in o
comparison o
with o
10,000 o
- o
ton o
spills o
that o
have o
occurred o
elsewhere o
, o
the o
situation o
here o
is o
worrisome o
because o
, o
as o
a o
petroleum o
importer o
, o
oil o
tankers o
ply o
the o
waters o
around o
our o
island o
in o
swarms o
. o

There o
is o
no o
telling o
when o
the o
next o
spill o
might o
happen o
. o

While o
acknowledging o
the o
necessity o
of o
drafting o
emergency o
response o
plans o
, o
academics o
argue o
that o
an o
even o
more o
pressing o
task o
facing o
the o
government o
is o
to o
catalog o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
marine o
resources o
. o

Otherwise o
, o
they o
say o
, o
it o
may o
be o
impossible o
to o
press o
reparation o
claims o
against o
shipping o
companies o
that o
accurately o
reflect o
the o
extent o
of o
damages o
. o

The o
lack o
of o
a o
detailed o
understanding o
of o
the o
Lungkeng B-GPE
ecology o
presents o
a o
perfect o
case o
in o
point o
. o

Similarly o
, o
after o
the o
recent o
spate o
of o
forest o
fires o
in o
central o
and o
southern o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
scholars o
have o
again o
reacted o
by o
calling o
on o
the o
government o
to o
begin o
as o
soon o
as o
possible o
with o
ongoing o
studies o
of o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
forest o
habitats o
. o

Investigations o
have o
shown o
that o
most o
of o
the o
recent o
forest o
fires o
plaguing o
Taiwan B-GPE
have o
been o
caused o
by o
campfires o
. o

Although o
the o
recent o
fires o
have o
been o
put o
out o
fairly o
quickly o
, o
a o
blaze o
on o
Snow B-LOC
Mountain I-LOC
caused o
alarm o
when o
it o
burned o
near o
a o
stand o
of o
rare o
Chinese o
hemlock o
as o
well o
as o
streams o
that o
are o
home o
to o
the o
Formosan o
landlocked o
salmon o
, o
which o
is o
regarded o
as o
a o
national o
treasure o
. o

Forestry o
service o
officials o
indicate o
that o
none o
of o
the o
recent o
blazes o
has o
caused o
major o
damage o
, o
but o
the B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of I-ORG
Agriculture I-ORG
has o
instructed o
the o
various o
forestry o
districts o
to o
step o
up o
patrols o
to o
keep o
man o
- o
made o
forest o
fires o
from o

again o
and o
again o

Chao B-PER
Jung I-PER
- I-PER
tai I-PER
, o
a o
researcher o
at o
Taiwan B-ORG
Forestry I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
, o
feels o
that o
the o
public o
ought o
to o
take o
the o
forest o
fires o
and o
the o
oil o
spill o
in o
Lungkeng B-GPE
as o
warnings o
of o
the o
urgent o
need o
to o
understand o
the o
environment o
in o
which o
we o
live o
. o

For o
example o
, o
Chao B-PER
asks o
: o
What o
are o
the o
scientific o
criteria o
for o
deciding o
when o
a o
forest o
fire o
has o
caused o
enough o
damage o
to o
require o
rehabilitation o
of o
the o
environment o
afterwards o
? o

Under o
what o
circumstances o
is o
it o
okay o
to o
let o
the o
environment o
recover o
on o
its o
own o
? o

These o
questions o
require o
ongoing o
monitoring o
and o
research o
before o
objective o
criteria o
can o
be o
developed o
and o
environmental o
rehabilitation o
efforts o
can o
be o
carried o
out o
properly o
. o

Once o
an o
environment o
that o
has o
taken o
shape o
over o
millions o
of o
years o
is o
destroyed o
, o
it o
is o
usually o
beyond o
man o
's o
ability o
to o
undo o
the o
damage o
. o

Efforts o
to o
that o
end o
often o
prove o
fruitless o
. o

It o
is o
time o
to o
start o
devoting o
serious o
thought o
to o
the o
question o
of o
how o
to o
preserve o
the o
beauty o
of o
the o
island o
we o
call o
home o
. o

Pinglin B-GPE
Township I-GPE
is o
situated o
in o
rural o
southern o
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
. o

Being o
relatively o
remote o
, o
the o
area o
was o
not o
developed o
until o
the o
late o
18th o
century o
. o

Pinglin B-GPE
is o
a o
pocket o
of o
level o
ground o
set o
in o
mountain o
forests o
, o
whence o
its o
name o
, o
which o
means o
" o
forest o
on o
level o
ground o
. o
" o

Arriving o
there o
, o
you o
're o
greeted o
by o
mountainsides o
of o
emerald o

the o
town o
of o
Pinglin B-GPE

and o
winding o

the B-LOC
Peishih I-LOC

, o
its o
crystal o
waters o
so o
clear o
that o
you o
can o
see o
right o
to o
the o
bottom o
. o

The o
population o
is o
steady o
at o
about o
6,000 o
- o
7,000 o
. o

It o
seems o
just o
the o
way o
it o
was o
20 o
- o
odd o
years o

, o
and o
gives o
the o
impression o
that o
in o

it o
will o
still o

this o

What o
is o
it o
about o
Pinglin B-GPE

nestled o
on o
the o

that o

In o
1979 o
, o
the o
Urban o
Development o
Law o
placed o
the o
Pinglin B-GPE
area o
under o
controls o
pertaining o
to o
Taipei B-GPE
's o
water o
catchment o
areas o
, o
and o
since o
then o
it o
has o
been o
extremely o
difficult o
to o
cultivate o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
agricultural o
land o
. o

Nor o
can o
more o
buildings o
be o
put o
up o
to o
cater o
to o
any o
increase o
in o
the o
population o
. o

All o
that o
can o
be o
done o
are o
just o
very o
minimal o
repairs o
and o
renovations o
to o
the o
already o
existing o
housing o
stock o
, o
and o
this o
has o
caused o
a o
sharp o
decline o
in o
the o
value o
of o
land o
there o
. o

Under o
the o
myriad o
regulations o
, o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
population o
has o
plummeted o

Although o

often o

's o
beautiful o

setting o
, o
but o
they o
exact o
a o
heavy o
toll o
from o
the o
local o
people o
. o

Luckily o
, o
Pinglin B-GPE
produces o
fine o
tea o
to o
follow o
the o
alcohol o
in o
which o
they o

A o
refined o
air o

Pinglin B-GPE
is o
an o
ideal o
location o
for o
tea o
cultivation o
, o
and o
many o
there o
had o
been o
doing o
it o
since o
way o
back o
, o
but o
after o
Pinglin B-GPE
started o
winning o
first o
prizes o
in o
the o
provincial o
government o
's o
tea o
competitions o
, o
the o
government o
began o
to o
pay o
serious o
attention o
to o
Pinglin B-GPE
tea o
. o

Moreover o
, o
seeing o
the o
profitability o
of o
tea o
, o
almost o
all o
the o
local o
farmers o
began o
specializing o
in o
tea o
. o

The o
freshly o
picked o
tips o
of o
Oolong o
tea o
, o
with o
their o
green o
buds o
and o

a o
bright o
and o
luminous o

when o

in o
hot o

Whether o
sold o
domestically o
or o

, o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
Pouchong o
tea o
enjoys o
a o
wide o
market o
and o
good o
distribution o

Both o
superior o
and o

grades o
of o
tea o
bring o
a o
good o

, o
and o
so o
for o
90 o
% o
of o
the o
people o
of o
Pinglin B-GPE
, o
life o
revolves o
around o
tea o

When o
the o
spring o
and o
autumn o
tea o
harvests o
are o
on o
, o
the o
people o
in o
every o
household o
can o
barely o
snatch o
four o
hours o
sleep o
a o
night o
, o
because o
the o
whole o
sequence o
from o
picking o
the o
tea o
leaves o
and o
processing o
them o
into o
their o
final o
form o
, o
requires o
more o
than o
ten o
uninterrupted o
hours o
, o
at o
the o

The o

of o

accompanies o
them o

awaits o

never o
got o
very o
far o
in o
school o
, o
so o
the o
best o
thing o
is o
to o
keep o
on o
growing o
tea o
. o
" o

When o
we o
turned o
to o
the o
secret o
of o
how o
to o
process o
good o
tea o
, o
Mr. o
Chen B-PER
was o
spare o
with o
words o
. o

" o
You o
need o
focus o
, o
and o
experience o
. o
" o

Indeed o
, o
to o
pick o
tea o
you o
have o
to o
take o
into o
account o
the o
weather o
and o
then o
, o
after o
selecting o
just o
the o
right o
time o
to o
pick o
, o
you o
carry o
out o
a o
series o
of o
fermentation o
steps o
that o
vary o
depending o
on o
just o
what o
the o
leaves o
are o
like o
that o
day o
. o

How o
long o
should o
the o
leaves o
ferment o
outdoors o
? o

How o
long o
indoors o
? o

These o
questions o
are o
decided o
by o
the o
grower o
, o
using o
everything o
at o
his o
disposal o
- o
eyes o
, o
nose o
, o
heart o
, o
mind o
, o
mouth o
, o
and o
hands o
, o
all o
working o
in o
harmony o
. o

A o
tiny o
bit o
more o
, o
a o
second o
less o
- o
it o
's o
a o
discipline o
and o
an o
art o
. o

Following o
fermentation o
, o
step o
by o
step o
, o
the o
tips o
are o
withered o
and o
crumbled o
, o
any o
lumps o
are o
broken o
up o
, o
then o
the o
tips o
are o
fired o
. o

Each o
of o
these o
steps o
affects o
the o
quality o
of o
the o
finished o
product o
. o

The o
timing o
must o
be o
accurately o
calculated o
, o
the o
temperature o
must o
be o
precise o
. o

Unfortunately o
, o
there o
are o
no o
standards o
to o
follow o
. o

Absolutely o
everything o
relies o
on o
each o
grower o
's o
store o
of o
personal o
experience o
. o

Tough o
times o
ahead o
for o
tea o
growers o
? o

The o
annual o
tea o
competition o
in o
Pinglin B-GPE
is o
a o
chance o
for o
tea o
growers o
to o
talk o
shop o
. o

They o
examine o
and o
appraise o
the o
teas o
, o
note o
the o
aroma o
and o
the o
color o
of o
the o
steeped o
tea o
, o
and o
assess o
the o
good o
and o
bad o
points o
of o
every o
family o
's o
tea o
. o

Different o
grades o
will o
bring o
different o
prices o
on o
the o
market o
. o

Award o
- o
winning o
teas o
often o
sell o
out o
. o

For o
better o
or o
worse o
, o
the o
tea o
growers o
' o
reputations o
are o
made o
on o
such o
occasions o
. o

According o
to o
Mr. o
Chen B-PER
, o
the o
growers o
compare o
themselves o
with o
each o
other o
, o
discussing o
their o
processing o
methods o
. o

When o
someone o
does o
n't o
do o
as o
well o
as o
they o
had o
hoped o
in o
a o
tea o
competition o
, o
they o
try o
to o
figure o
out o
why o
their o
tea o
did o
n't o
match o
up o
with o
that o
of o
other o
growers o
. o

" o
You o
need o
to o
constantly o
reflect o
, o
review o
and o
discuss o
your o
processing o
. o

That o
's o
the o
only o
way o
to o
improve o
the o
quality o
. o
" o

These o
days o
, o
about o
80 o
% o
of o
the o
people o
in o
Pinglin B-GPE
still o
depend o
on o
tea o
for o
their o
livelihood o
. o

With o
the o
economy o
slowing o
down o
, o
however o
, o
tea o
is o
not o
as o
easy o
to o
sell o
as o
it o
used o
to o
be o
. o

In o
the o
past o
there o
used o
to o
be o
a o
vigorous o
export o
market o
, o
but o
the o
countries o
of o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
have o
cut o
into o
the o
market o
. o

Pinglin B-GPE
has o
always o
specialized o
in o
quality o
teas o
rather o
than o
cater o
to o
the o
mass o
- o
production o
foreign o
tea o
markets o
, o
but o
if o
even o
domestic o
sales o
are o
having o
difficulties o
, o
what o
can o
the o
growers o
do o
to o
ensure o
their o
livelihoods o
? o

Huang B-PER
Kuei I-PER
- I-PER
ying I-PER
also o
comments o
that o
tea o
is o
n't o
as o
easy o
to o
sell o
as o
it o
once o
was o
. o

Growers o
are o
sometimes o
exploited o
by o
middlemen o
, o
and o
the o
tea o
grown o
with o
their o
sweat o
and o
blood o
ends o
up o
being o
sold o
for o
a o
very o
low o
price o
. o

" o
It o
's o
terrible o
! o

Many o
growers o
just o
ca o
n't o
find o
words o
for o
what o
's o
happening o
, o
especially o
with o
what o
's o
going o
to o
happen o
later o
, o
joining o
that o
whatever o
- o
it o
- o
is o
trade o
organization o
. o

That o
could o
really o
be o
a o
disaster o
! o
" o

Huang B-PER
's o
concerns o
may o
well o
be o
shared o
by o
many o
others o
. o

Nevertheless o
, o
Mr. o
Chen B-PER
has o
deep o
confidence o
, o
" o
As o
long o
as o
our o
tea o
is o
good o
, o
we o
need o
n't o
fear o
that o
no o
- o
one o
will o
buy o
it o
! o
" o

The o
township o
chief o
, o
Liang B-PER
Chin I-PER
- I-PER
sheng I-PER
, o
does o
n't o
hide o
his o
pride o
in o
and o
his o
concerns o
about o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
tea o
industry o
. o

Says o
Liang B-PER
, o
" o
Here o
in o
Pinglin B-GPE
we o
worship o
tea o
as o
a o
god o
. o

We o
look o
after o
it o
like o
a o
sweetheart o
. o
" o

As o
well o
as o
encouraging o
the o
local o
people o
to o
constantly o
enhance o
their o
tea o
growing o
and o
processing o
skills o
, o
he o
devotes o
even o
more o
energy o
to o
managing o
the o
" o
tea o
culture o
" o
to o
which o
tea o
has o
given o
rise o
, o
including o
by o
- o
products o
such o
as o
tea o
pastries o
and o
similar o
light o
refreshments o
. o

But o
far o
more o
important o
, o
is o
to o
draw o
deeply o
on o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
unique o
and o
refined o
qualities o
as o
a o
tea o
district o
and o
imbue o
the o
hearts o
and o
minds o
of o
local o
inhabitants o
and o
visitors o
alike o
with o
a o
deep o
appreciation o
of o
tea o
culture o
. o

With o
this o
in o
mind o
they o
are o
training o
local o
people o
to o
do o
voluntary o
cultural o
work o
, o
organizing o
activities o
associated o
with o
tea o
, o
producing o
and o
conserving o
local o
gazetteers o
and o
histories o
, o
all o
richly o
steeped o
in o
the o
style o
and o
romance o
of o
tea o
. o

Speaking o
of o
the o
assaults o
they o
face o
with o
the o
opening o
of o
the o
market o
, o
the o
township o
chief o
knits o
his o
brows o
tightly o
, o

" o
I o
hope o
the o
government o
can o
do o
something o
substantial o
to o
promote o
Taiwanese o
tea o
and o
draw o
up o
regulations o
for o
proper o
channels o
for o
marketing o
tea o
. o

Let o
everyone o
see o
how o
good o
it o
is o
to o
drink o
tea o
, o
and o
experience o
for o
themselves o
tea o
's o
benefits o
. o

This o
is o
the o
only o
way o
that o
tea o
will o
have o
a o
market o
; o
and o
then o
the o
younger o
generation o
will o
be o
willing o
to o
take o
over o
from o
us o
. o
" o

Hoping o
for o
fewer o
regulations o

In o
early o
times o
Pinglin B-GPE
was o
a o
key o
waystation o
on o
the o
Old o
Tan o
Lan o
Trail o
leading o
from o
Taipei B-GPE
to o
Ilan B-GPE
. o

These o
days o
the o
old o
road o
has o
been o
replaced o
by o
the o
Taipei o
- o
Ilan o
Highway o
. o

The o
current o
road o
brings o
a o
lot o
of o
visitors o
to o
Pinglin B-GPE
and o
has o
made o
transport o
of o
the o
tea o
produce o
much o
easier o
. o

It o
was o
originally o
thought o
that o
the o
Taipei o
- o
Ilan o
Expressway o
, o
due o
for o
completion o
in o
2003 o
, o
would o
also o
bring o
Pinglin B-GPE
new o
benefits o
, o
but o
the o
government o
is o
now o
planning o
to o
restrict o
the o
interchange o
to o
only o
large o
vehicles o
and o
locals o
from o
Pinglin B-GPE
. o

This o
is o
in o
order o
to o
protect o
the o
water o
catchment o
area o
. o

The o
township o
chief o
throws o
up o
his o
hands o
and o
comments o
with o
exasperation o
that o
in o
everything o
the o
government o
has o
done o
it o
has o
treated o
the o
local o
people o
officiously o
and o
shown o
no o
confidence o
in o
them o
. o

In o
his o
view o
, o
the o
government o
should o
think o
of o
some o
way o
whereby o
both o
Pinglin B-GPE
and o
the o
water o
resource o
protection o
zone o
can o
coexist o
and o
prosper o
. o

If o
they o
're o
afraid o
that o
the o
new o
expressway o
will o
bring o
hordes o
of o
people o
and o
pollute o
the o
water o
resources o
, o
then o
what o
they o
should o
do o
, o
within o
reasonable o
bounds o
, o
is o
allow o
the o
people o
here o
to o
build o
public o
facilities o
for o
visitors o
which o
will o
help o
minimise o
their o
impact o
on o
the o
local o
ecology o
, o
for o
example o
public o
toilets o
and o
comprehensive o
rubbish o
disposal o
. o

This o
would o
give o
people o
from o
outside o
the o
area o
more o
opportunity o
to o
appreciate o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
idyllic o
natural o
setting o
. o

The o
local o
people o
have o
formed o
a o
fish o
conservation o
team o
and o
as o
a o
result o
the B-LOC
Peishih I-LOC
River I-LOC
is o
now o
protected o
. o

Many o
prized o
species o
of o
Taiwanese o
fish o
are o
being o
propagated o
. o

In o
the o
pristine o
forests o
are o
ancient o
pine o
forests o
with o
species o
unique o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
, o
and o
the o
deep o
blue o
skies o
attract o
waves o
of o
students o
to o
Pinglin B-GPE
to o
camp o
out o
and o
observe o
the o
stars o
. o

The o
calloused o
hands o
of o
the o
tea o
growers o
are o
steeped o
with o
the o
vitality o
of o
tea o
. o

Last o
year o
Pinglin B-GPE
's o
Pouchong o
tea o
earned o
the o
" o
Presidential o
Seal o

" o

The o
tea o
growers o
straighten o
their o
backs o
, o
throwing o
themselves o
into o
the o
tea o
processing o
, o
and o
wait o
for o

of o
fine o

So o
, o
next o
time o
you o
go o
to o

please o
do o
n't o
just o
treat o
it o

When o
I o
threw o
temper o
tantrums o

As o
a o
young o
girl o
/ o

On o
summer o
afternoons o
/ o

My o
grandmother o
would o
soothe o
me o
/ o

By o
gently o
singing o
an o
old o
song o

It o
went o
like o
this o

The o
sky o
is o
dark o

It o
's o
going o
to o
rain o

The o
sky o

Are o
there o
always o
hidden o
flaws o
in o
the o
grown o

up o

Every o
day o
I o
come o
to o

How o
lonely o
I o
've o
become o
! o

When o
skies o
are o

I o
recall o
that o
song o

And o
hope o
to o
hear o
the o
peaceful o
sound o
of o

turns o
out o

sang o

Sun B-GPE
's o
first o
hit o
last o
June o
, o
caused o
an o
immediate o
sensation o
. o

The o
critic o
G B-PER
Moon I-PER
praised o
it o
as o
a o
marvelous o
blend o
of o
seemingly o
familiar o
melody o
and o
lyrics o
, o
with o
solo o
piano o
accompaniment o
from o
start o
to o
finish o
. o

People o
found o
Sun B-PER
's o
singing o
voice o
fresh o
, o
clean o
and o
infectiously o
charming o
, o
and o
it o
quickly o
earned o
her o
a o
place o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
music o
world o
. o

Fresh o
and o
clean o

Sun B-PER
clearly o
occupies o
an o
enviable o
position o
in o
the o
singing o
world o
. o

Yet o
it o
is o
hard o
to o
pin o
down o
exactly o
where o
that o
position o
is o
. o

Although o
she o
has o
written o
a o
few o
songs o
herself o
, o
these o
are o
not o
among o
her o
better o
works o
, o
so o
she o
can o
not o
be o
properly o
placed o
among o
the o
" o
singer o
- o
songwriters o
. o
" o

And o
while o
her o
voice o
sets o
her o
apart o
, o
she o
has o
not o
perfected o
her o
live o
performance o
skills o
, o
so o
she o
can o
not o
be o
included o
among o
the o
true o
divas o
. o

Moreover o
, o
her o
short o
hair o
, o
buck o
teeth o
and o
aversion o
to o
wearing o
skirts o
and o
dresses o
would o
seem o
to o
exclude o
her o
from o
the o
teeny o
- o
bopper o
" o
idols o
. o
" o

Finally o
, o
she o
ca o
n't o
be o
considered o
an o
innovator o
. o

Half o
her o
songs o
are o
slow o
and o
half o
are o
fast o
, o
and o
she o
has o
n't o
revealed o
much o
desire o
to o
experiment o
. o

Indeed o
, o
Internet o
bulletin o
boards o
are o
full o
of o
posts o
wondering o
why o
exactly o
Sun B-PER
Yan I-PER
Zi I-PER
is o
so o
popular o
. o

" o
How o
did o
she o
get o
so o
popular o
overnight o
? o

Her o
looks o
and o
voice o
are o
pretty o
average o
. o
" o

" o
She o
's o
not o
beautiful o
, o
but o
her o
smile o
and o
singing o
voice o
are o
pleasing o
. o

She o
makes o
people o
feel o
comfortable o
. o
" o

" o
She o
does o
n't o
really o
have o
any o
special o
quality o
to o
speak o
of o
, o
which o
seems o
to o
be o
the o
case o
with o
most o
of o
the o
Southeast o
Asian o
singers o

that o

was o

an o

student o
at o
his o
music o
academy o
, o
and o
that o
her o
rapid o
success o
has o
surprised o
many o
people o
. o

But o
he o
conjectures o
that o
the o
freshness o
and o
intimacy o
that o
she o

may o
be o
responsible o
for o
her o

Wang B-PER
notes o

" o
Sun B-PER
Yan I-PER
Zi I-PER
fills o
this o
need o
perfectly o
. o
" o

Moreover o
, o
she o
has o
had o
the o
right o
material o
, o
with o
producer o
Peter B-PER
Li I-PER
providing o
songs o
that o
have o
individual o
character o
but o
stop o
short o
of o
being o
avant o
garde o
. o

This o
has o
allowed o
her o
to o
stand o
apart o
from o
the o
pop o
singers o
who o
just o
blindly o
follow o
the o
marketplace o
. o

Hence o
, o
though o
she o
is o
neither o
a o
singer o
- o
songwriter o
, o
nor o
an o
outstanding o
vocalist o
, o
nor o
a o
conventional o
teen o
idol o
, o
she o
has o
nevertheless o
been o
able o
to o
attain o
brilliant o
success o
in o
an o
era o
where o
premiums o
are o
placed o
on o
both o
" o
changing o
constantly o
" o
and o
" o
returning o
to o
the o
basics o

Talent o
exchange o

In o
a o
weak o
market o
for o
recorded o
music o
, o
Sun B-PER
's o
two o
albums o
have o
sold o
very o
well o
. o

Members o
of o
the o
media o
have o
quipped o
that o
those o
who o
work o
at o
Taiwan B-GPE
's o
Warner B-ORG
Music I-ORG
can o
thank o
two o
Singaporeans o
, o
Sun B-PER
and o
her o
producer o
Li B-PER
, o
for o
any o
bonuses o
they o
made o
last o
year o
. o

Now o
people o
have o
started o
wondering o
if o
overseas o
Chinese o
from o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
- o
and o
in o
particular o
from o
Singapore B-GPE
and o
Malaysia B-GPE
- o
are o
taking o
over o
the o
mainstream o
of o
the o
Taiwanese o
music o
industry o
. o

In o
earlier o
decades o
Southeast o
Asian o
singers o
were o
unusual o
here o
. o

In o
the o
1970s o
and o
1980s o
there o
was o
Teng B-PER
Miao I-PER
- I-PER
hua I-PER
and o
Wen B-PER
Chang I-PER
. o

Then o
Eric B-PER
Moo I-PER
appeared o
on o
the o
scene o
in o
the o
1990s o
. o

Although o
these o
were o
all o
successful o
singers o
, o
they o
comprised o
a o
small o
group o
. o

But o
in o
the o
last o
five o
years o
or o
so o
, o
there o
has o
been o
a o
steady o
stream o
of o
Southeast o
Asian o
singers o
making o
their o
mark o
in o
Taiwan B-GPE
: o
Mavis B-PER
Hee I-PER
, o
Mindy B-PER
, o
Kit B-PER
Chan I-PER
, o
Tanya B-PER
Chua I-PER
, o
Michael B-ORG
and I-ORG
Victor I-ORG
, o
Angelica B-PER
Lee I-PER
, o
Penny B-PER
, o
Fish B-PER
Leong I-PER
, o
and o
Tae B-PER
Kheng I-PER
Seong I-PER
. o

Interestingly o
, o
almost o
all o
of o
them o
have o
been o
described o
as o
being o
" o
fresh o
and o
clean o
. o
" o

Moreover o
, o
even o
those o
who o
write o
their o
own o
material o
, o
such o
as o
Tanya B-PER
Chua I-PER
, o
Michael B-ORG
and I-ORG
Victor I-ORG
, o
and o
Tae B-PER
Kheng I-PER
Seong I-PER
, o
write o
simple o
folk o
songs o
. o

Although o
the o
Southeast o
Asians o
have o
n't o
had o
quite o
the o
impact o
of o
the o
returning o
overseas o
Chinese o
from o
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
, o
they o
have o
staked o
out o
their o
piece o
of o
the o
pop o
music o
field o
. o

Music o
critic o
Tsai B-PER
Yun I-PER
- I-PER
pu I-PER
notes o
that o
the o
Southeast o
Asian o
singers o
are o
not o
as o
recognizable o
as o
their o
counterparts o
from o
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
, o
who o
have o
a o
hard o
- o
rocking o
, o
R-AMP-B o
style o
. o

The o
simple o
and o
catchy o
melodies o
and o
rhythms o
of o
the o
Southeast o
Asians o
sound o
a o
lot o
like o
those o
of o
the o
locals o
. o

Taiwanese o
listeners o
quickly o
identify o
with o
these o
singers o
and o
may o
even o
forget o
where o
they o
come o
from o
. o

" o
Taiwan B-GPE
is o
now o
the o
capital o
of o
Mandarin o
pop o
music o
worldwide o
, o
" o
says o
Tsai B-PER
. o

" o
If o
there o
's o
a o
' o
capital o
, o
' o
then o
there o
are o
' o
provinces o
. o
' o
" o

The o
market o
is o
too o
small o
in o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
, o
so o
it o
has o
become o
de o
rigueur o
for o
Southeast o
Asian o
Chinese o
singers o
to o
come o
to o
Taiwan B-GPE
to o
advance o
their o
careers o
. o

Those o
with o
talent o
are o
quickly o
adopted o
by o
local o
audiences o
. o
" o

Wang B-PER
Tzu I-PER
- I-PER
hsien I-PER
argues o
that o
the o
growing o
dominance o
of o
multi-national o
companies o
in o
the o
Taiwanese o
music o
field o
has o
fostered o
uniformity o
here o
, o
and o
the o
Southeast o
Asians o
have o
been o
able o
to o
step o
in o
and o
fill o
the o
need o
for o
greater o
creativity o
. o

Yet o
though o
their o
music o
may o
be o
" o
fresher o
, o
" o
on o
close o
inspection o
it o
does o
n't o
really o
differ o
that o
much o
from o
what o
is o
produced o
by o
the o
locals o
. o

It o
is o
, o
after o
all o
, o
produced o
for o
the o
same o
market o
. o

Although o
there o
may o
not o
be o
much o
that o
sets o
the o
Southeast o
Asians o
apart o
, o
the o
growing o
exchange o
of o
musical o
talent o
between o
Taiwan B-GPE
and o
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
has o
at o
least o
provided o
ample o
content o
for o
the o
gossip o
pages o
. o

When o
Sun B-PER
wore o
a o
long o
jacket o
while o
shooting o
a o
music o
video o
, o
people o
could o
tell o
how o
excited o
she o
was o
at o
wearing o
a o
winter o
coat o
for o
the o
first o
time o
. o

At o
that o
moment o
, o
Taiwan B-GPE
did o
n't o
seem o
to o
be o
that o
far o
from o
Singapore B-GPE
, o
despite o
the o
latter o
's o
endless o
summer o
weather o
. o

We o
all o
could o
sense o
a o
young o
woman o
's o
joy o
at o
being o
accepted o
in o
foreign o
land o
that o
seemed o
at o
once o
familiar o
and o
exotic o
