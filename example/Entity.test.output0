The o
National o
Statistical o
Bureau o
forecasts o
that o
the o
global o
economy o
will o
continue o
growing o
in o
1996 o
and o
that o
this o
favorable o
situation o
is o
extremely o
beneficial o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
development o
and o
will o
provide o
many o
development o
opportunities o
. o

According o
to o
the o
forecast o
, o
this o
year o
's o
global o
economic o
growth o
rate o
will o
reach o
4.1 o
percent o
. o

The o
main o
factor o
promoting o
economic o
growth o
is o
the o
still o
powerful o
economic o
development o
in o
the o
Asian o
region o
. o

The o
whole o
region o
's o
economic o
growth o
rate o
will o
reach o
7.9 o
percent o
, o
with o
China B-GPE
's o
growth o
rate o
possibly o
being o
as o
high o
as o
9.7 o
percent o
. o

According o
to o
the o
analysis o
of o
the o
National o
Statistical o
Bureau o
, o
the o
extremely o
favorable o
conditions o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
development o
mainly o
comprise o
of o
two o
aspects o
: o
the o
first o
being o
the o
sustained o
growth o
of o
the o
world o
economy o
and o
international o
trade o
, o
which o
indicates o
the o
steady o
expansion o
of o
international o
market o
demands o
, o
provides o
a o
comparatively o
favorable o
international o
environment o
for o
China B-GPE
's o
export o
trade o
development o
. o

The o
second o
is o
China B-GPE
's o
large o
margin o
reduction o
of o
tariffs o
in o
1996 o
which o
will o
further o
improve o
its o
investment o
environment o
and o
attract o
more o
foreign o
businessmen o
to o
come o
to o
invest o
. o

The o
analysis o
shows o
that o
, o
with o
the o
situation o
of o
greater o
opportunity o
and o
extremely o
favorable o
international o
situations o
, o
China B-GPE
's o
economic o
development o
still o
faces o
severe o
challenges o
this o
year o
. o

With o
a o
background o
of o
rapid o
economic o
development o
, o
there o
still o
exist o
many o
difficulties o
, o
among o
these o
are o
outstanding o
problems o
such o
as o
inflation o
, o
a o
weak o
agricultural o
base o
, o
insufficient o
vitality o
in o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
, o
etc o
. o

While o
implementing o
global o
trade o
liberalization o
, o
China B-GPE
must o
implement o
reforms o
on o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
so o
as o
to o
improve o
its o
own o
competitiveness o
. o

Currently o
, o
some o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
are o
having o
management o
difficulties o
, o
moreover o
the o
debt o
of o
state o
- o
owned o
enterprises o
reaches o
as o
high o
as o
700 o
billion o
yuan o
, o
and o
their o
product o
quality o
is o
uneven o
. o

If o
there o
is o
no o
improvement o
, o
it o
will o
be o
very o
difficult o
for o
them o
to o
participate o
in o
the o
competition o
in o
overseas o
markets o
. o

According o
to o
analysis o
, o
at o
present o
, o
the o
rising o
speed o
of o
developing o
countries o
' o
economies o
also o
makes o
China B-GPE
face o
fierce o
international o
competition o
in o
domains o
such o
as o
attracting o
foreign o
funds o
, o
introducing o
technology o
, o
expanding o
markets o
and o
developing o
high o

City o
the o
focus o
has o
been o
placed o
on o
rectifying o
the o
problem o
of o
low o
work o
efficiency o
. o

The o
speed o
of o
examining o
and o
approving o
the o

capital o
enterprises o
has o
been o
limited o
from o
originally o

The o
